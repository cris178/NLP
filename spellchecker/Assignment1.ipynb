Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the', 'pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some', 'high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better', 'seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in', 'lath and plaster- tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to', 'desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they', 'here?', '', 'But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and', 'seemingly bound for a dive. Strange!

Why did the', 'poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of', 'silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed,', 'or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is', 'almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at', 'some time or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as', 'a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when', 'first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why', 'did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a', 'separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not', 'without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of', 'Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image', 'he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that', 'same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans.  It is the', 'image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it', 'all.', '', 'Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I', 'begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of', 'my lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as', 'a passenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse,', 'and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides,', \"passengers get sea-sick- grow quarrelsome- don't sleep of nights- do\", 'not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;- no, I never go as a', 'passenger; nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea', 'as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and', 'distinction of such offices to those who like them. For my part, I', 'abominate all honorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations', 'of every kind whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take', 'care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs,', 'schooners, and what not. And as for going as cook,- though I confess', 'there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer', 'on ship-board- yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;- though', 'once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and', 'peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to', 'say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of the', 'idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted', 'river horse, that you see the mummies of those creatures in their', 'huge bakehouses the pyramids.', '', 'No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,', 'plumb down into the fore-castle, aloft there to the royal', 'mast-head. True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump', 'from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first,', \"this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one's sense of\", 'honor, particularly if you come of an old established family in the', 'land, the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more', 'than all, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you', 'have been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest', 'boys stand in awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you,', 'from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of', 'Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even', 'this wears off in time.', '', 'What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a', 'broom and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to,', 'weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the', 'archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly', 'and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who', \"ain't a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains\", 'may order me about- however they may thump and punch me about, I have', 'the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else', 'is one way or other served in much the same way- either in a physical', 'or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is', \"passed round, and all hands should rub each other's shoulder-blades,\", 'and be content.', '', 'Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of', 'paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single', 'penny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves', 'must pay. And there is all the difference in the world between paying', 'and being paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable', 'infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But being', 'paid,- what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a', 'man receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so', 'earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that', 'on no account can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we', 'consign ourselves to perdition!', '', 'Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome', 'exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world,', 'head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if', 'you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the', 'Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from', 'the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but', 'not so. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in', 'many other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect', 'it. But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea', 'as a merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a', 'whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who', 'has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and', 'influences me in some unaccountable way- he can better answer than', 'any one else. And, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed', 'part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a long', 'time ago. It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between', 'more extensive performances. I take it that this part of the bill', 'must have run something like this:', '', '\"Grand Contested Election', 'for the Presidency of the United States.\"', '', '\"Whaling voyage by one Ishmael.\"', '', '\"Bloody battle in Affghanistan.\"', '', 'Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the Fates, put me', 'down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others were set down for magnificent', 'parts in high tragedies, and short and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in', 'farces- though I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the', 'circumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives which being', 'cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced me to set about performing the', 'part I did, besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my', 'own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment.', '', 'Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great', 'whale himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my', 'curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island', 'bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with', 'all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds,', 'helped to sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things', 'would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with', 'an everlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas,', 'and land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick', 'to perceive a horror, and could still be social with it- would they', 'let me- since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the', 'inmates of the place one lodges in.', '', 'By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the', 'great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild', 'conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into', 'my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of', 'them all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.', '', '', '', '', 'The Carpet-Bag', '', '', 'I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my', 'arm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good', 'city of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a', 'Saturday night in December. Much was I disappointed upon learning', 'that the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no', 'way of reaching that place would offer, till the following Monday.', '', 'As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop', 'at this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as', 'well be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind', 'was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there', 'was a fine, boisterous something about everything connected with that', 'famous old island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New', 'Bedford has of late been gradually monopolizing the business of', 'whaling, and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much', 'behind her, yet Nantucket was her great original- the Tyre of this', 'Carthage;- the place where the first dead American whale was', 'stranded. Where else but from Nantucket did those aboriginal', 'whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes to give chase to the', 'Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket, too, did that first', 'adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported', 'cobblestones- so goes the story- to throw at the whales, in order to', 'discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the', 'bowsprit?', '', 'Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before', 'me in New Bedford, ere could embark for my destined port, it became a', 'matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was', 'a very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly', 'cold and cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels', 'I had sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,-', 'So, wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the', 'middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the', 'towards the north with the darkness towards the south- wherever in', 'your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael,', \"be sure to inquire the price, and don't be too particular.\", '', 'With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of \"The', 'Crossed Harpoons\"- but it looked too expensive and jolly', 'there. Further on, from the bright red windows of the \"Sword-Fish', 'Inn,\" there came such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the', 'packed snow and ice from before the house, for everywhere else the', 'congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,-', 'rather weary for me, when I struck my foot against the flinty', 'projections, because from hard, remorseless service the soles of my', 'boots were in a most miserable plight. Too expensive and jolly, again', 'thought I, pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street,', 'and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within. But go on,', \"Ishmael, said I at last; don't you hear?  get away from before the\", 'door; your patched boots are stopping the way. So on I went. I now by', 'instinct followed the streets that took me waterward, for there,', 'doubtless, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns.', '', 'Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand,', 'and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. At', 'this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of', 'the town proved all but deserted. But presently I came to a smoky', 'light proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which stood', 'invitingly open. It had a careless look, as if it were meant for the', 'uses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did was to', 'stumble over an ash-box in the porch. Ha!  thought I, ha, as the', 'flying particles almost choked me, are these ashes from that', 'destroyed city, Gomorrah? But \"The Crossed Harpoons,\" and the \"The', 'Sword-Fish?\"- this, then must needs be the sign of \"The Trap.\"', 'However, I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within, pushed', 'on and opened a second, interior door.', '', 'It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred', 'black faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black', 'Angel of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church;', \"and the preacher's text was about the blackness of darkness, and the\", 'weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered', \"I, backing out, Wretched entertainment at the sign of 'The Trap!'\", '', 'Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the', 'docks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a', 'swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly', 'representing tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words', 'underneath- \"The Spouter Inn:- Peter Coffin.\"', '', 'Coffin?- Spouter?- Rather ominous in that particular connexion,', 'thought I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I', 'suppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there. As the light', 'looked so dim, and the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and', 'the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have', 'been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district, and as the', 'swinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought', 'that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea', 'coffee.', '', 'It was a queer sort of place- a gable-ended old house, one side', 'palsied as it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak', 'corner, where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse', \"howling than ever it did about poor Paul's tossed craft.  Euroclydon,\", 'nevertheless, is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with', 'his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed. \"In of that tempestuous', 'wind called Euroclydon,\" says an old writer- of whose works I possess', 'the only copy extant- \"it maketh a marvellous difference, whether', 'thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on', 'the outside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless window,', 'where the frost is on both sides, and of which the wight Death is the', 'only glazier.\" True enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my', 'mind- old black-letter, thou reasonest well. Yes, these eyes are', \"windows, and this body of mine is the house. What a pity they didn't\", 'stop up the chinks and the crannies though, and thrust in a little', \"lint here and there. But it's too late to make any improvements\", 'now. The universe is finished; the copestone is on, and the chips', 'were carted off a million years ago. Poor Lazarus there, chattering', 'his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow, and shaking off his', 'tatters with his shiverings, he might plug up both ears with rags,', 'and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not keep out', 'the tempestuous Euroclydon.  Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his red', 'silken wrapper- (he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What a', 'fine frosty night; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them', 'talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories;', 'give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals.', '', 'But what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them', 'up to the grand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in', 'Sumatra than here?

Yet Dives himself, he too lives', 'like a Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a', 'president of a temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of', 'orphans.', '', 'But no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there', 'is plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our frosted', 'feet, and see what sort of a place this \"Spouter\" may be.', '', '', '', '', 'The Spouter-Inn', '', '', 'Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,', 'low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of', 'the bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very', 'large oil painting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced,', 'that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only', 'by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it, and', 'careful inquiry of the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an', 'understanding of its purpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades and', 'shadows, that at first you almost thought some ambitious young', 'artist, in the time of the New England hags, had endeavored to', 'delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint of much and earnest', 'contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and especially by', 'throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry, you at', 'last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however wild, might', 'not be altogether unwarranted.', '', 'But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber,', 'portentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the', 'picture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a', 'nameless yeast.

But last all\", 'these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in the', \"picture's midst. That once found out, and all the rest were\", 'plain. But stop; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic', 'fish? even the great leviathan himself?', '', \"In fact, the artist's design seemed this: a final theory of my own,\", 'partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with', 'whom I conversed upon the subject. The picture represents a', 'Cape-Horner in a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering', 'there with its three dismantled masts alone visible; and an', 'exasperated whale, purposing to spring clean over the craft, is in', 'the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast-heads.', '', 'The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish', 'array of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with', 'glittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots', 'of human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping', 'round like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed', 'mower. You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous', 'cannibal and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such', 'a hacking, horrifying implement.

Of things not properly belonging to the room, there', 'was a hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner;', \"also a large seaman's bag, containing the harpooneer's wardrobe, no\", 'doubt in lieu of a land trunk. Likewise, there was a parcel of', 'outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place, and a', 'tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.', '', 'But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the', 'light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to', 'arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare', 'it to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with', 'little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills', 'round an Indian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in the middle of', 'this mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos. But could it', 'be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and', 'parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put', 'it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being', 'uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though', 'this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day. I went', 'up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw', 'such a sight in my life. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that', 'I gave myself a kink in the neck.', '', 'I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this', 'head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time', 'on the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then', 'stood in the middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat,', 'and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel', 'very cold now, half undressed as I was, and remembering what the', \"landlord said about the harpooneer's not coming home at all that\", 'night, it being so very late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of', 'my pantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light tumbled into', 'bed, and commended myself to the care of heaven.', '', 'Whether that mattress was stuffed with corncobs or broken crockery,', 'there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not', 'sleep for a long time. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had', 'pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I', 'heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light', 'come into the room from under the door.', '', 'Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal', 'head-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a', 'word till spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical', 'New Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and', 'without looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off', 'from me on the floor in one corner, and then began working away at', 'the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the', 'room. I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for', \"some time while employed in unlacing the bag's mouth. This\", 'accomplished, however, he turned round- when, good heavens; what a', 'sight! Such a face! It was of a dark, purplish, yellow color, here', \"and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares. Yes, it's\", \"just as I thought, he's a terrible bedfellow; he's been in a fight,\", 'got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon. But at', 'that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I', 'plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black', 'squares on his cheeks. They were stains of some sort or other. At', 'first I knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the', 'truth occurred to me. I remembered a story of a white man- a whaleman', 'too- who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by them. I', 'concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his distant voyages,', 'must have met with a similar adventure. And what is it, thought I,', \"after all! It's only his outside; a man can be honest in any sort of\", 'skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly complexion, that part', 'of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely independent of the', 'squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be nothing but a good coat', \"of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot sun's tanning a white\", 'man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had never been in the', 'South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary', 'effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were passing', 'through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at', 'all. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced', 'fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a', 'seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest in', 'the middle of a room, he then took the New Zealand head- a ghastly', 'thing enough- and crammed it down into the bag. He now took off his', 'hat- a new beaver hat- when I came nigh singing out with fresh', 'surprise.  There was no hair on his head- none to speak of at least-', 'nothing but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald', 'purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had', 'not the stranger stood between me and the door, I would have bolted', 'out of it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner.', '', 'Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window,', 'but it was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of', 'this headpeddling purple rascal altogether passed my', 'comprehension. Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely', 'nonplussed and confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as', 'much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken', 'into my room at the dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him', 'that I was not game enough just then to address him, and demand a', 'satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.', '', 'Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last', 'showed his chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were', 'checkered with the same squares as his face, his back, too, was all', \"over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years'\", 'War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still', 'more, his very legs were marked, as a parcel of dark green frogs were', 'running up the trunks of young palms. It was now quite plain that he', 'must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman', 'in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked', 'to think of it. A peddler of heads too- perhaps the heads of his own', 'brothers. He might take a fancy to mine- heavens! look at that', 'tomahawk!', '', 'But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about', 'something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me', 'that he must indeed be a heathen.  Going to his heavy grego, or', 'wrapall, or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he', 'fumbled in the pockets, and produced at length a curious little', 'deformed image with a hunch on its back, and exactly the color of a', \"three days' old Congo baby.  Remembering the embalmed head, at first\", 'I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved', 'some similar manner. But seeing that it was not at all limber, and', 'that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded that', 'it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to', 'be. For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing', 'the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image, like', 'a tenpin, between the andirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks', 'inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very', 'appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.', '', 'I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but', 'ill at ease meantime- to see what was next to follow. First he takes', 'about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and', 'places them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship', 'biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the', 'shavings into a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty', 'snatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers', '(whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded', 'in drawing out the biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a', 'little, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro. But the', 'little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he', 'never moved his lips. All these strange antics were accompanied by', 'still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be', 'praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other,', 'during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner. At', 'last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very', 'unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as', 'carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.', '', 'All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and', 'seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business', 'operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,', 'now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in', 'which I had so long been bound.', '', 'But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal', 'one. Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of', 'it for an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth', 'at the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next', 'moment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk', 'between his teeth, sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I could not', 'help it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began', 'feeling me.', '', 'Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him', 'against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might', 'be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. But', 'his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill', 'comprehended my meaning.', '', '\"Who-e debel you?\"- he at last said- \"you no speak-e, dam-me, I', 'kill-e.\" And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about', 'me in the dark.', '', '\"Landlord, for God\\'s sake, Peter Coffin!\" shouted I. \"Landlord!', 'Watch!  Coffin! Angels! save me!\"', '', '\"Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!\" again growled', 'the cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered', 'the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on', 'fire. But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the', 'room light in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.', '', '\"Don\\'t be afraid now,\" said he, grinning again, \"Queequeg here', 'wouldn\\'t harm a hair of your head.\"', '', '\"Stop your grinning,\" shouted I, \"and why didn\\'t you tell me that', 'that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?\"', '', '\"I thought ye know\\'d it;- didn\\'t I tell ye, he was a peddlin\\' heads', 'around town?- but turn flukes again and go to sleep.

Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when', 'I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended', 'their hues together; and it was only by the sense of weight and', 'pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was hugging me.', '', 'My sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a', 'child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell', 'me; whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely', 'settle. The circumstance was this.

I felt', 'dreadfully. But there was no help for it, so up stairs I went to my', 'little room in the third floor, undressed myself as slowly as', 'possible so as to kill time, and with a bitter sigh got between the', 'sheets.', '', 'I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must', 'elapse before I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed!', 'the small of my back ached to think of it.  And it was so light too;', 'the sun shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in', 'the streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt', 'worse and worse- at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in', 'my stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw', 'myself at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favor to give me a', 'good slippering for my misbehaviour: anything indeed but condemning', 'me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time. But she was the', 'best and most conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to', 'my room. For several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great', 'deal worse than I have ever done since, even from the greatest', 'subsequent misfortunes.

Instantly I felt a shock running through all my', 'frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a', 'supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.

For', 'what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with the most', 'awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking that', 'if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be', 'broken.

For though I tried to move his arm-', 'unlock his bridegroom clasp- yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged', 'me tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain. I now', 'strove to rouse him- \"Queequeg!\"- but his only answer was a snore.  I', 'then rolled over, my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar;', 'and suddenly felt a slight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane,', \"there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage's side, as if it were a\", 'hatchet-faced baby. A pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a', 'strange house in the broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk!', '\"Queequeg!- in the name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!\" At length, by', 'dint of much wriggling, and loud and incessant expostulations upon', 'the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial', 'sort of style, I succeeded in extracting a grunt; and presently, he', 'drew back his arm, shook himself all over like a Newfoundland dog', 'just from the water, and sat up in bed, stiff as a pike-staff,', 'looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether', 'remember how I came to be there, though a dim consciousness of', 'knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him. Meanwhile,', 'I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings now, and bent', 'upon narrowly observing so curious a creature.  When, at last, his', 'mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow, and he', 'became, as it were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon the', 'floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that, if', 'it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to dress', 'afterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself. Thinks I,', 'Queequeg, under the circumstances, this is a very civilized overture;', 'but, the truth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy,', 'say what you will; it is marvellous how essentially polite they', 'are. I pay this particular compliment to Queequeg, because he treated', 'me with so much civility and consideration, while I was guilty of', 'great rudeness; staring at him from the bed, and watching all his', 'toilette motions; for the time my curiosity getting the better of my', \"breeding. Nevertheless, a man like Queequeg you don't see every day,\", 'he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding.', '', 'He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall', 'one, by the by, and then- still minus his trowsers- he hunted up his', 'boots. What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his', 'next movement was to crush himself- boots in hand, and hat on- under', 'the bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I', 'inferred he was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of', 'propriety that I ever heard of, is any man required to be private', 'when putting on his boots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature', 'in the transition stage- neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was', 'just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest', 'possible manners. His education was not yet completed. He was an', 'undergraduate. If he had not been a small degree civilized, he very', 'probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all; but then,', 'if he had not been still a savage, he never would have dreamt of', 'getting under the bed to put them on.  At last, he emerged with his', 'hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes, and began', 'creaking and limping about the room, as if, not being much accustomed', 'to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones- probably not made', 'to order either- rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off', 'of a bitter cold morning.', '', 'Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the', 'street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view', 'into the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that', 'Queequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots', 'on; I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet', 'somewhat, and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as', 'possible. He complied, and then proceeded to wash himself. At that', 'time in the morning any Christian would have washed his face; but', 'Queequeg, to my amazement, contented himself with restricting his', 'ablutions to his chest, arms, and hands. He then donned his', 'waistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash-stand', 'centre table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering his', 'face. I was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and', 'behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long', 'wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and', 'striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous', 'scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks. Thinks I, Queequeg,', \"this is using Rogers's best cutlery with a vengeance. Afterwards I\", 'wondered the less at this operation when I came to know of what fine', 'steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp the', 'long straight edges are always kept.', '', 'The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out', 'of the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and', \"sporting his harpoon like a marshal's baton.\", '', '', '', '', 'Breakfast', '', '', 'I quickley followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted', 'the grinning landlord very pleasantly. I cherished no malice towards', 'him, though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter', 'of my bedfellow.', '', 'However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a', \"good thing; the more's the pity. So, if any one man, in his own\", 'proper person, afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not', 'be backward, but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and to be', 'spent in that way.

Yes, it was the famous Father Mapple, so called by the', 'whalemen, among whom he was a very great favorite. He had been a', 'sailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for many years past had', 'dedicated his life to the ministry. At the time I now write of,', 'Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age; that sort', 'of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth, for', 'among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain mild', 'gleams of a newly developing bloom- the spring verdure peeping forth', \"even beneath February's snow. No one having previously heard his\", 'history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the', 'utmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical', 'peculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life', 'he had led. When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella,', 'and certainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran', 'down with melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed', 'almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had', 'absorbed. However, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one', 'removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner; when,', 'arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.', '', 'Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a', 'regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the', 'floor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the', 'architect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and', 'finished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular', 'side ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at', 'sea. The wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a', 'handsome pair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being', 'itself nicely headed, and stained with a mahogany color, the whole', 'contrivance, considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no', 'means in bad taste.  Halting for an instant at the foot of the', 'ladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the', 'man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly', 'sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted', 'the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.', '', 'The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case', 'with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were', 'of wood, so that at every step there was a joint. At my first glimpse', 'of the pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient for a', 'ship, these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary. For I', 'was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height,', 'slowly turn round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up', 'the ladder step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving', 'him impregnable in his little Quebec.', '', 'I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for', 'this. Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and', 'sanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any', 'mere tricks of the stage. No, thought I, there must be some sober', 'reason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something', 'unseen. Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he', 'signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward', 'worldly ties and connexions?

But what is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches?', 'Shipmates, it is a two-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful', 'men, and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living God. As sinful men,', 'it is a lesson to us all, because it is a story of the sin,', 'hard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift punishment,', 'repentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah. As', 'with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of Amittai was in his', 'wilful disobedience of the command of God- never mind now what that', 'command was, or how conveyed- which he found a hard command. But all', 'the things that God would have us do are hard for us to do- remember', 'that- and hence, he oftener commands us than endeavors to', 'persuade. And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it is in', 'this disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God', 'consists.', '', '\"With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at', 'God, by seeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men,', 'will carry him into countries where God does not reign but only the', 'Captains of this earth. He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and', \"seeks a ship that's bound for Tarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a\", 'hitherto unheeded meaning here.

Because', 'Joppa, the modern Jaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly coast of', 'the Mediterranean, the Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two', 'thousand miles to the westward from that, just outside the Straits of', 'Gibraltar.

Jonah sees this; but in\", 'vain he tries to look all ease and confidence; in vain essays his', 'wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the man assure the mariners he', 'can be no innocent.

He reads, and', 'looks from Jonah to the bill; while all his sympathetic shipmates now', 'crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their hands upon him. Frightened', 'Jonah trembles. and summoning all his boldness to his face, only', 'looks so much the more a coward. He will not confess himself', 'suspected; but that itself is strong suspicion.

Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up\", 'to Jonah, though the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he', \"hear that hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance. 'We sail\", \"with the next coming tide,' at last he slowly answered, still\", \"intently eyeing him. 'No sooner, sir?'- 'Soon enough for any honest\", \"man that goes a passenger.' Ha! Jonah, that's another stab. But he\", \"swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent. 'I'll sail with ye,'-\", \"he says,- 'the passage money how much is that?- I'll pay now.'

So Jonah's Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah's\", 'purse, ere he judge him openly. He charges him thrice the usual sum;', \"and it's assented to.

All dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his', 'berth, and finds the little state-room ceiling almost resting on his', 'forehead. The air is close, and Jonah gasps.

He goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless', 'commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into', 'the yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory', 'teeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison.

He looked like a man who had', 'never cringed and never had had a creditor. Whether it was, too, that', 'his head being shaved, his forehead was drawn out in freer and', 'brighter relief, and looked more expansive than it otherwise would,', 'this I will not venture to decide; but certain it was his head was', 'phrenologically an excellent one. It may seem ridiculous, but it', \"reminded me of General Washington's head, as seen in the popular\", 'busts of him.

Queequeg was George', 'Washington cannibalistically developed.', '', 'Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to', 'be looking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my', 'presence, never troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but', 'appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous', 'book. Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the', 'night previous, and especially considering the affectionate arm I had', 'found thrown over me upon waking in the morning, I thought this', 'indifference of his very strange. But savages are strange beings; at', 'times you do not know exactly how to take them. At first they are', 'overawing; their calm self-collectedness of simplicity seems as', 'Socratic wisdom. I had noticed also that Queequeg never consorted at', 'all, or but very little, with the other seamen in the inn. He made no', 'advances whatever; appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle', 'of his acquaintances. All this struck me as mighty singular; yet,', 'upon second thoughts, there was something almost sublime in it. Here', 'was a man some twenty thousand miles from home, by the way of Cape', 'Horn, that is- which was the only way he could get there- thrown', 'among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet', 'Jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease; preserving the', 'utmost serenity; content with his own companionship; always equal to', 'himself. Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt', 'he had never heard there was such a thing as that. But, perhaps, to', 'be true philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of so living', 'or so striving.

I felt a melting in me. No more', 'my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish', 'world. This soothing savage had redeemed it. There he sat, his very', 'indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized', 'hypocrisies and bland deceits. he was; a very sight of sights to see;', 'yet I began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him. And those', 'same things that would have repelled most others, they were the very', \"magnets that thus drew me. I'll try a pagan friend, thought I, since\", 'Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy. I drew my bench', 'near him, and made some friendly signs and hints, doing my best to', 'talk with him meanwhile.

In', 'a countryman, this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far', 'too premature, a thing to be much distrusted; but in this simple', 'savage those old rules would not apply.', '', 'After supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room', 'together. He made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his', 'enormous tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out some', 'thirty dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and', 'mechanically dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of', 'them towards me, and said it was mine. I was going to remonstrate;', \"but he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers' pockets. I let\", 'them stay. He then went about his evening prayers, took out his idol,', 'and removed the paper firebrand. By certain signs and symptoms, I', 'thought he seemed anxious for me to join him; but well knowing what', 'was to follow, I deliberated a moment whether, in case he invited me,', 'I would comply or otherwise.', '', 'I was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible', 'Presbyterian Church. How then could I unite with this wild idolator', 'in worshipping his piece of wood?  But what is worship? thought I.

The schooner was run into the wind, and while the', 'hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped to the', 'waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap.

All round,', 'her unpanelled, open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw,', 'with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for', 'pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to. Those thews ran', 'not through base blocks of land wood, but deftly travelled over', 'sheaves of sea-ivory.

And when', 'these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a', 'globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness', 'and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and', 'beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to', \"think untraditionally and independently; receiving all nature's sweet\", 'or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and', 'confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from', 'accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language-', \"that man makes one in a whole nation's census- a mighty pageant\", 'creature, formed for noble tragedies.

But unlike Captain Peleg- who cared not a rush for what are', 'called serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious', 'things the veriest of all trifles- Captain Bildad had not only been', 'originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket', 'Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many', 'unclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn- all that had not', 'moved this native born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as', 'altered one angle of his vest.

Indolence and', 'idleness perished before him. His own person was the exact embodiment', 'of his utilitarian character.  On his long, gaunt body, he carried no', 'spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical', 'nap to it, like that worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.', '', 'Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I', 'followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin.

Ye have been', 'studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my', 'certain knowledge.

I was already aware that in the whaling', 'business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the captain,', 'received certain shares of the profits called lays, and that these', 'lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the', \"respective duties of the ship's company.

And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather long', 'lay, yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a lucky voyage,', 'might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it, not', \"to speak of my three years' beef and board, for which I would not\", 'have to pay one stiver.', '', 'It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely', 'fortune- and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those', 'who never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if', 'the world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at', 'this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought the', '275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been', 'surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was of a', 'broad-shouldered make.', '', 'But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about', 'receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had', 'heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony', 'Bildad; how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod,', 'therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners,', \"left nearly the whole management of the ship's affairs to these\", 'two. And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a', 'mighty deal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found', 'him on board the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and', 'reading his Bible as if at his own fireside.

His', 'pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped up in it,', 'and embalmed with inner health and strength, like a revivified', 'Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to', 'come, and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow or torrid', 'sun, like a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was warranted', 'to do well in all climates.

Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude,', 'there were certain qualities in him which at times affected, and in', 'some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest.  Uncommonly', 'conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep natural reverence,', 'the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline', 'him to superstition; but to that sort of superstition, which in some', 'organization seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than', 'from ignorance.

Besides, he thought, perhaps, that', 'in this business of whaling, courage was one of the great staple', 'outfits of the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be', 'foolishly wasted.  Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales', 'after sun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much', 'persisted in fighting him.

There was a corporeal humility in looking up at him; and a', 'white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce', 'of a fortress.

As for the residue of the Pequod's company, be it said,\", 'that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men', 'before the mast employed in the American whale fishery, are Americans', 'born, though pretty nearly all the officers are. Herein it is the', 'same with the American whale fishery as with the American army and', 'military and merchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in', 'the construction of the American Canals and Railroads. The same, I', 'say, because in all these cases the native American literally', 'provides the brains, the rest of the world as generously supplying', 'the muscles.

But it was especially the aspect of the three', 'chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was most forcibly', 'calculated to allay these colorless misgivings, and induce confidence', 'and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage. Three better,', 'more likely sea-officers and men, each in his own different way,', 'could not readily be found, and they were every one of them', 'Americans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape man.  Now, it being', 'Christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor, for a space we had', 'biting Polar weather, though all the time running away from it to the', 'southward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we', 'sailed, gradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its', 'intolerable weather behind us. It was one of those less lowering, but', 'still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when with a', 'fair wind the ship was rushing through the water with a vindictive', 'sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted to the', 'deck at the call of the forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled my', 'glance towards the taffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me. Reality', 'outran apprehension; Captain Ahab stood upon his quarter-deck.', '', 'There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the', 'recovery from any.

His whole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze,', \"and shaped in an unalterable mould, like Cellini's cast\", 'Perseus. Threading its way out from among his grey hairs, and', 'continuing right down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck,', 'till it disappeared in his clothing, you saw a slender rod-like mark,', 'lividly whitish. It resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made', 'in the straight, lofty trunk of a great tree, when the upper', 'lightning tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching a single', 'twig, peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom ere running', 'off into the soil, leaving the tree still greenly alive, but', 'branded. Whether that mark was born with him, or whether it was the', 'scar left by some desperate wound, no one could certainly say.

Yet, this wild hint seemed inferentially', 'negatived, by what a grey Manxman insinuated, an old sepulchral man,', 'who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had never ere this', 'laid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless, the old sea-traditions, the', 'immemorial credulities, popularly invested this old Manxman with', 'preternatural powers of discernment. So that no white sailor', 'seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab', 'should be tranquilly laid out- which might hardly come to pass, so he', 'muttered- then, whoever should do that last office for the dead,', 'would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.', '', 'So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the', 'livid brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I', 'hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing', 'to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood. It had', 'previously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned', 'from the polished bone of the sperm whale\\'s jaw. \"Aye, he was', 'dismasted off Japan,\" said the old Gay-Head Indian once; \"but like', 'his dismasted craft, he shipped another mast without coming home for', 'it.

There was an infinity of\", 'firmest fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the', 'fixed and fearless, forward dedication of that glance.  Not a word he', 'spoke; nor did his officers say aught to him; though by all their', 'minutest gestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if', 'not painful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye.

There are some preliminaries to settle.', '', 'First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology', 'is in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters', 'it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In his', 'System of Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnaeus declares, \"I hereby separate', 'the whales from the fish.\" But of my own knowledge, I know that down', 'to the year 1850, sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against', \"Linnaeus's express edict, were still found dividing the possession of\", 'the same seas with the Leviathan.', '', 'The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whales', 'from the waters, he states as follows: \"On account of their warm', 'bilocular heart, their lungs, their moveable eyelids, their hollow', 'ears, penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,\" and finally, \"ex', 'lege naturae jure meritoque.\" I submitted all this to my friends', 'Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine', 'in a certain voyage, and they united in the opinion that the reasons', 'set forth were altogether insufficient.  Charley profanely hinted', 'they were humbug.', '', 'Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned', 'ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back', 'me. This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what', 'internal respect does the whale differ from other fish. Above,', 'Linnaeus has given you those items. But in brief they are these:', 'lungs and warm blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold', 'blooded.', '', 'Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as', 'conspicuously to label him for all time to come. To be short, then, a', 'whale is a spouting fish with a horizontal tail. There you have', 'him. However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded', 'meditation. A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not', 'a fish, because he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition', 'is still more cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must', 'have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat,', 'but a vertical, or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the', 'tail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a', 'horizontal position.', '', 'By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude', 'from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified', 'with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other', 'hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as', 'alien. Hence, all the smaller, spouting and horizontal tailed fish', 'must be included in this ground-plan of cetology.

He is, without doubt, the', 'largest inhabitant of the globe; the most formidable of all whales to', 'encounter; the most majestic in aspect; and lastly, by far the most', 'valuable in commerce; he being the only creature from which that', 'valuable substance, spermaceti, is obtained. All his peculiarities', 'will, in many other places, be enlarged upon. It is chiefly with his', 'name that I now have to do. Philologically considered, it is', 'absurd. Some centuries ago, when the sperm whale was almost wholly', 'unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his oil was only', 'accidentally obtained from the stranded fish; in those days', 'spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from', 'a creature identical with the one then known in England as the', 'Greenland or Right Whale.

It was only to be had from the', 'druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine,', 'in the course of time, the true nature of spermaceti became known,', 'its original name was still retained by the dealers; no doubt to', 'enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of its', 'scarcity.

It is', 'the Great Mysticetus of the English naturalists; the Greenland Whale', 'of the English whaleman; the Baliene Ordinaire of the French', 'whalemen; the Growlands Walfish of the Swedes. It is the whale which', 'for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and', 'English in the Arctic seas; it is the whale which the American', 'fishermen have long pursued in the Indian ocean, on the Brazil Banks,', \"on the Nor' West Coast, and various other parts of the world,\", 'designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds.', '', 'Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the', 'English and the right whale of the Americans.

It is by endless subdivisions based upon the most', 'inconclusive differences, that some departments of natural history', 'become so repellingly intricate. The right whale will be elsewhere', 'treated of at some length, with reference to elucidating the sperm', 'whale.', '', 'BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER III. (Fin-Back).', 'Under this head I reckon a monster which, by the various names of', 'Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and Long-John, has been seen almost in every', 'sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often descried', 'by passengers crossing the Atlantic, in the New York', 'packet-tracks. In the length he attains, and in his baleen, the', 'Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less portly girth,', 'and a lighter color, approaching to olive. His great lips present a', 'cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting folds of', 'large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin, from which', 'he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin is some', 'three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder part of', 'the back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed', 'end. Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible,', 'this isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the', 'surface. When the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with', 'spherical ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts', 'shadows upon the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the', 'watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its', 'style and wavy hour-lines graved on it. On that Ahaz-dial the shadow', 'often goes back. The Fin-Back is not gregarious. He seems a', 'whale-hater, as some men are man-haters. Very shy; always going', 'solitary; unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most', 'sullen waters; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall', 'misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous', 'power and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from', 'man; this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his', 'race, bearing for his mark that style upon his back. From having the', 'baleen in his mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes included with the', 'right whale, among a theoretic species denominated Whalebone whales,', 'that is, whales with baleen. Of these so-called Whalebone whales,', 'there would seem to be several varieties, most of which, however, are', 'little known.

How then? The baleen, hump, back-fin,', 'and teeth; these are things whose peculiarities are indiscriminately', 'dispersed among all sorts of whales, without any record to what may', 'be the nature of their structure in other and more essential', 'particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale, each has', 'a hump; but there the similitude ceases. Then this same humpbacked', 'whale and the Greenland whale, each of these has baleen; but there', 'again the similitude ceases. And it is just the same with the other', 'parts above mentioned. In various sorts of whales, they form such', 'irregular combinations; or, in the case of any one of them detached,', 'such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all general', 'methodization formed upon such a basis. On this rock every one of the', 'whale-naturalists has split.', '', 'But it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the', 'whale, in his anatomy- there, at least, we shall be able to hit the', 'right classification.

(Narwhale), that is, Nostril whale.', 'Another instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose from', 'his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. The', 'creature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five', 'feet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen', 'feet. Strictly speaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing', 'out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the', 'horizontal.

In', \"those days, the captain's authority was restricted to the navigation\", 'and general management of the vessel; while over the whale-hunting', 'department and all its concerns, the Specksynder or Chief Harpooneer', 'reigned supreme.

Indeed,', 'many are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper', 'parading his quarter-deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in', 'any military navy; nay, extorting almost as much outward homage as if', 'he wore the imperial purple, and not the shabbiest of pilot-cloth.', '', 'And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least', 'given to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only', 'homage he ever exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though', 'he required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping', 'upon the quarter-deck; and though there were times when, owing to', 'peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to be', 'detailed, he addressed them in unusual terms, whether of', 'condescension or in terrorem, or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was', 'by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea.', '', 'Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind', 'those forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself;', 'incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than', 'they were legitimately intended to subserve. That certain sultanism', 'of his brain, which had otherwise in a good degree remained', 'unmanifested; through those forms that same sultanism became', \"incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship.

I do not suppose that for the', 'world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest', 'observation, even upon so neutral a topic as the weather. No! And', 'when reaching out his knife and fork, between which the slice of beef', \"was locked, Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck's plate towards him, the\", 'mate received his meat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly;', 'and a little started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the', 'plate; and chewed it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without', 'circumspection. For, like the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where', 'the German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven imperial electors,', 'so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful', 'silence; and yet at table old Ahab forbade not conversation; only he', 'himself was dumb.

His were', 'the shin-bones of the saline beef; his would have been the', 'drumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help himself, this must', 'have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree. Had he', 'helped himself at the table, doubtless, never more would he have been', 'able to hold his head up in this honest world; nevertheless, strange', 'to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask helped himself, the', 'chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it. Least of all, did', 'Flask presume to help himself to butter.

But for all this, the great negro was', 'wonderfully abstemious, not to say dainty. It seemed hardly possible', 'that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the', 'vitality diffused through so broad, baronial, and superb a', 'person. But, doubtless, this noble savage fed strong and drank deep', 'of the abounding element of air; and through his dilated nostrils', 'snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds.

I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the', 'old Egyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to', 'them. For though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must', 'doubtless, by their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest', 'mast-head in all Asia, or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was', 'put to it) as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have', \"gone by the board, in the dread gale of God's wrath; therefore, we\", 'cannot give these Babel builders priority over the Egyptians.

In Saint Stylites,', 'the famous Christian hermit of old times, who built him a lofty stone', 'pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life', 'on its summit, hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle; in', 'him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless', 'stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his place by', 'fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing everything', 'out to the last, literally died at his post. Of modern', 'standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron,', 'and bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale,', 'are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon', 'discovering any strange sight. There is Napoleon; who, upon the top', 'of the column of Vendome stands with arms folded, some one hundred', 'and fifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below,', 'whether Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil.

The worthy Obed tells us,', 'that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were', 'regularly launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island', 'erected lofty spars along the seacoast, to which the look-outs', 'ascended by means of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in', 'a hen-house. A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay', 'whalemen of New Zealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to', 'the ready-manned boats nigh the beach. But this custom has now become', 'obsolete; turn we then to the one proper mast-head, that of a', 'whale-ship at sea. The three mast-heads are kept manned from sun-rise', 'to sun-set; the seamen taking their regular turns (as at the helm),', 'and relieving each other every two hours. In the serene weather of', 'the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head: nay, to a', 'dreamy meditative man it is delightful. There you stand, a hundred', 'feet above the silent decks, striding along the deep, as if the masts', 'were gigantic stilts, while beneath you and between your legs, as it', 'were, swim the hugest monsters of the sea, even as ships once sailed', 'between the boots of the famous Colossus at old Rhodes.  There you', 'stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea, with nothing ruffled', 'but the waves. The tranced ship indolently rolls; the drowsy trade', 'winds blow; everything resolves you into languor. For the most part,', 'in this tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness invests you;', 'you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras with startling accounts of', 'commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements; you hear', 'of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt securities; fall of stocks; are', 'never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner-', 'for all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in', 'casks, and your bill of fare is immutable.', '', \"In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years'\", 'voyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at', 'the mast-head would amount to several entire months. And it is much', 'to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a', 'portion of the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly', 'destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or', 'adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains', 'to a bed, a hammock, a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or', 'any other of those small and snug contrivances in which men', 'temporarily isolate themselves. Your most usual point of perch is the', \"head of the t' gallant-mast, where you stand upon two thin parallel\", \"sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen) called the t' gallant\", 'crosstrees. Here, tossed about by the sea, the beginner feels about', \"as cosy as he would standing on a bull's horns. To be sure, in cold\", 'weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of a', 'watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more', 'of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul is glued inside of', 'its fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely move about in it, nor even', 'move out of it, without running great risk of perishing (like an', 'ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so a watch-coat', 'is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope, or additional', 'skin encasing you. You cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your', 'body, and no more can you make a convenience closet of your', 'watch-coat.', '', 'Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of', 'a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents', \"or pulpits, called crow's-nests, in which the look-outs of a\", 'Greenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the', 'frozen seas. In the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled \"A', 'Voyage among the Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and', 'incidentally for the re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of', 'Old Greenland;\" in this admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads', 'are furnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then', \"recently invented crow's-nest of the Glacier, which was the name of\", \"Captain Sleet's good craft. He called it the Sleet's crow's-nest, in\", 'honor of himself; he being the original inventor and patentee, and', 'free from all ridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call', 'our own children after our own names (we fathers being the original', 'inventors and patentees), so likewise should we denominate after', \"ourselves any other apparatus we may beret. In shape, the Sleet's\", \"crow's-nest is something like a large tierce or pipe; it is open\", 'above, however, where it is furnished with a movable sidescreen to', 'keep to windward of your head in a hard gale. Being fixed on the', 'summit of the mast, you ascend into it through a little trap-hatch in', 'the bottom. On the after side, or side next the stern of the ship, is', 'a comfortable seat, with a locker underneath for umbrellas,', 'comforters, and coats. In front is a leather rack, in which to keep', 'your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and other nautical', 'conveniences. When Captain Sleet in person stood his mast-head in', \"this crow's-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a rifle with\", 'him (also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask and shot,', 'for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or vagrant sea', 'unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot successfully shoot at', 'them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water, but to shoot', 'down upon them is a very different thing. Now, it was plainly a labor', 'of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all the little', \"detailed conveniences of his crow's-nest; but though he so enlarges\", 'upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very scientific', \"account of his experiments in this crow's-nest, with a small compass\", 'he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting', 'from what is called the \"local attraction\" of all binnacle magnets;', 'an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the', \"ship's planks, and in the Glacier's case, perhaps, to there having\", 'been so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew; I say, that', 'though the Captain is very discreet and scientific here, yet, for all', 'his learned \"binnacle deviations,\" \"azimuth compass observations,\"', 'and \"approximate errors,\" he knows very well, Captain Sleet, that he', 'was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations, as', 'to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished', \"little case-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow's\", 'nest, within easy reach of his hand. Though, upon the whole, I', 'greatly admire and even love the brave, the honest, and learned', 'Captain; yet I take it very ill of him that he should so utterly', 'ignore that case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend and comforter', 'it must have been, while with mittened fingers and hooded head he was', \"studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird's nest within three\", 'or four perches of the pole.', '', 'But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as', 'Captain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is', 'greatly counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those', 'seductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float. For one, I', 'used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to', 'have a chat with Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find', 'there; then ascending a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg', 'over the top-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the watery', 'pastures, and so at last mount to my ultimate destination.', '', 'Let me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept', 'but sorry guard.

But not all of them knew of', 'his existence; a few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen him;', 'while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given battle', 'to him, was small indeed. For, owing to the large number of', 'whale-cruisers; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the', 'entire watery circumference, many of them adventurously pushing their', 'quest along solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole', 'twelvemonth or more on a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling', 'sail of any sort; the inordinate length of each separate voyage; the', 'irregularity of the times of sailing from home; all these, with other', 'circumstances, direct and indirect, long obstructed the spread', 'through the whole world-wide whaling-fleet of the special', 'individualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick. It was hardly to be', 'doubted, that several vessels reported to have encountered, at such', 'or such a time, or on such or such a meridian, a Sperm Whale of', 'uncommon magnitude and malignity, which whale, after doing great', 'mischief to his assailants, has completely escaped them; to some', 'minds it was not an unfair presumption, I say, that the whale in', 'question must have been no other than Moby Dick. Yet as of late the', 'Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent', 'instances of great ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster', 'attacked; therefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly', 'gave battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps, for the most part,', 'were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred, more, as it', 'were, to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large, than to the', 'individual cause. In that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter', 'between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded.', '', 'And as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by', 'chance caught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had', 'every one of them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him,', 'as for any other whale of that species. But at length, such', 'calamities did ensue in these assaults- not restricted to sprained', 'wrists and ankles, broken limbs, or devouring amputations- but fatal', 'to the last degree of fatality; those repeated disastrous repulses,', 'all accumulating and piling their terrors upon Moby Dick; those', 'things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters, to', 'whom the story of the White Whale had eventually come.', '', 'Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the', 'more horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters. For not', 'only do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all', 'surprising terrible events,- as the smitten tree gives birth to its', 'fungi; but, in maritime life, far more than in that of terra firma,', 'wild rumors abound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them', 'to cling to. And as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the', 'whale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the', 'wonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate', 'there. For not only are whalemen as a body unexempt from that', 'ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors; but of all', 'sailors, they are by all odds the most directly brought into contact', 'with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea; face to face', 'they not only eye its greatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle', 'to them. Alone, in such remotest waters, that though you sailed a', 'thousand miles, and passed a thousand shores, you would not come to', 'any chiselled hearth-stone, or aught hospitable beneath that part of', 'the sun; in such latitudes and longitudes, pursuing too such a', 'calling as he does, the whaleman is wrapped by influences all tending', 'to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth. No wonder, then,', 'that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the wildest', 'watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in the end', 'incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints, and', 'half-formed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies, which', 'eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from', 'anything that visibly appears. So that in many cases such a panic did', 'he finally strike, that few who by those rumors, at least, had heard', 'of the White Whale, few of those hunters were willing to encounter', 'the perils of his jaw.', '', 'But there were still other and more vital practical influences at', 'work. Nor even at the present day has the original prestige of the', 'Sperm Whale, as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the', 'leviathan, died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body. There are', 'those this day among them, who, though intelligent and courageous', 'enough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale, would', 'perhaps- either from professional inexperience, or incompetency, or', 'timidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale; at any rate, there', 'are plenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not', 'sailing under the American flag, who have never hostilely encountered', 'the Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is', 'restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North;', 'seated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish', 'fireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern', 'whaling. Nor is the preeminent tremendousness of the great Sperm', 'Whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those', 'prows which stem him.', '', 'And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary', 'times thrown its shadow before it; we find some book naturalists-', 'Olassen and Povelson- declaring the Sperm Whale not only to be a', 'consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to be so', 'incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human', \"blood. Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier's, were these or\", 'almost similar impressions effaced. For in his Natural History, the', 'Baron himself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish', '(sharks included) are \"struck with the most lively terrors,\" and', '\"often in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against', 'the rocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death.\" And', 'however the general experiences in the fishery may amend such reports', 'as these; yet in their full terribleness, even to the bloodthirsty', 'item of Povelson, the superstitious belief in them is, in some', 'vicissitudes of their vocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.', '', 'So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few', 'of the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier', 'days of the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to', 'induce long practised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this', 'new and daring warfare; such men protesting that although other', 'leviathans might be hopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lances', 'at such an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man. That', 'to attempt it, would be inevitably to be torn into a quick', 'eternity. On this head, there are some remarkable documents that may', 'be consulted.', '', 'Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things', 'were ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number', 'who, chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the', 'specific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious', 'accompaniments were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if', 'offered.', '', 'One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be', 'linked with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously', 'inclined, was the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous;', 'that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one', 'and the same instant of time.', '', 'Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit', 'altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability. For', 'as the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been', 'divulged, even to the most erudite research; so the hidden ways of', 'the Sperm Whale when beneath the surface remain, in great part,', 'unaccountable to his pursuers; and from time to time have originated', 'the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them,', 'especially concerning the mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a', 'great depth, he transports himself with such vast swiftness to the', 'most widely distant points.', '', 'It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships,', 'and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by', 'Scoresby, that some whales have been captured far north in the', 'Pacific, in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted', 'in the Greenland seas. Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of', 'these instances it has been declared that the interval of time', 'between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many', 'days. Hence, by inference, it has been believed by some whalemen,', \"that the Nor' West Passage, so long a problem to man, was never a\", 'problem to the whale. So that here, in the real living experience of', 'living men, the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello', 'mountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in', 'which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface); and that still', 'more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse (whose', 'waters were believed to have come from the Holy Land by an', 'underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost fully', 'equalled by the realities of the whalemen.', '', 'Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and', 'knowing that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had', 'escaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some', 'whalemen should go still further in their superstitions; declaring', 'Moby Dick not only ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but', 'ubiquity in time); that though groves of spears should be planted in', 'his flanks, he would still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should', 'ever be made to spout thick blood, such a sight would be but a', 'ghastly deception; for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of', 'leagues away, his unsullied jet would once more be seen.', '', 'But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough', 'in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to', 'strike the imagination with unwonted power. For, it was not so much', 'his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm', 'whales, but, as was elsewhere thrown out- a peculiar snow-white', 'wrinkled forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump. These were his', 'prominent features; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless,', 'uncharted seas, he revealed his identity, at a long distance, to', 'those who knew him.', '', 'The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with', 'the same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his', 'distinctive appellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally', 'justified by his vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through', 'a dark blue sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all', 'spangled with golden gleamings.', '', 'Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet', 'his deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural', 'terror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to', 'specific accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his', 'assaults. More than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of', 'dismay than perhaps aught else. For, when swimming before his', 'exulting pursuers, with every apparent symptom of alarm, he had', 'several times been known to turn round suddenly, and, bearing down', 'upon them, either stave their boats to splinters, or drive them back', 'in consternation to their ship.', '', 'Already several fatalities had attended his chase. But though similar', 'disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual in', \"the fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White Whale's\", 'infernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or death', 'that he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by', 'an unintelligent agent.', '', 'Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds', 'of his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of', 'chewed boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out', \"of the white curds of the whale's direful wrath into the serene,\", 'exasperating sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.', '', 'His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in', 'the eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow,', 'had dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly', 'seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the', 'whale. That captain was Ahab. And then it was, that suddenly sweeping', 'his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped away', \"Ahab's leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field. No turbaned\", 'Turk, no hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more', 'seeming malice. Small reason was there to doubt, then, that ever', 'since that almost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild', 'vindictiveness against the whale, all the more fell for that in his', 'frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him, not only all', 'his bodily woes, but all his intellectual and spiritual', 'exasperations. The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac', 'incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel', 'eating in them, till they are left living on with half a heart and', 'half a lung. That intangible malignity which has been from the', 'beginning; to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe', 'one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east', 'reverenced in their statue devil;- Ahab did not fall down and worship', 'it like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred', 'white whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, against it. All that', 'most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things; all', 'truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the', 'brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to', 'crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable', \"in Moby Dick. He piled upon the whale's white hump the sum of all the\", 'general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and', \"then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart's\", 'shell upon it.', '', 'It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise', 'at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting at', 'the monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden,', 'passionate, corporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that', 'tore him, he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but', 'nothing more.  Yet, when by this collision forced to turn towards', 'home, and for long months of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay', 'stretched together in one hammock, rounding in mid winter that', 'dreary, howling Patagonian Cape; then it was, that his torn body and', 'gashed soul bled into one another; and so interfusing, made him', 'mad.

But not so did it', 'seem to Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents; and', \"thereby calculating the driftings of the sperm whale's food; and,\", 'also calling to mind the regular, ascertained seasons for hunting him', 'in particular latitudes; could arrive at reasonable surmises, almost', 'approaching to certainties, concerning the timeliest day to be upon', 'this or that ground in search of his prey.', '', 'So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the', \"sperm whale's resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe\", 'that, could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world;', 'were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully', 'collated, then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to', 'correspond in invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the', 'flights of swallows. On this hint, attempts have been made to', 'construct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale.', '', 'Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another,', 'the sperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct- say, rather,', 'secret intelligence from the Deity- mostly swim in veins, as they are', 'called; continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such', 'undeviating exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any', 'chart, with one tithe of such marvellous precision. Though, in these', 'cases, the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a', \"surveyor's parallel, and though the line of advance be strictly\", 'confined to its own unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary', 'vein in which at these times he is said to swim, generally embraces', 'some few miles in width (more or less, as the vein is presumed to', 'expand or contract); but never exceeds the visual sweep from the', \"whale-ship's mast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along this magic\", 'zone. The sum is, that at particular seasons within that breadth and', 'along that path, migrating whales may with great confidence be looked', 'for.', '', 'And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate', 'feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in', 'crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could,', 'by his art, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to', 'be wholly without prospect of a meeting.', '', 'There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his', 'delirious but still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality,', 'perhaps. Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular', 'seasons for particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude', 'that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude', 'this year, say, will turn out to be identically the same with those', 'that were found there the preceding season; though there are peculiar', 'and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved', 'true. In general, the same remark, only within a less wide limit,', 'applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm', 'whales. So that though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for', 'example, on what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean,', 'or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow that were', 'the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent', 'corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter him there. So,', 'too, with some other feeding-grounds, where he had at times revealed', 'himself. But all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and', 'ocean-inns, so to speak, not his places of prolonged abode. And where', \"Ahab's chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken\", 'of, allusion has only been made to whatever way-side, antecedent,', 'extra prospects were his, ere a particular set time or place were', 'attained, when all possibilities would become probabilities, and, as', 'Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the next thing to a', 'certainty. That particular set time and place were conjoined in the', 'one technical phrase- the Season-on-the-Line. For there and then, for', 'several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been periodically descried,', 'lingering in those waters for awhile, as the sun, in its annual', 'round, loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of the', 'Zodiac. There it was, too, that most of the deadly encounters with', 'the white whale had taken place; there the waves were storied with', 'his deeds; there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old', 'man had found the awful motive to his vengeance. But in the cautious', 'comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which Ahab threw his', 'brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt, he would not permit himself', 'to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning fact above mentioned,', 'however flattering it might be to those hopes; nor in the', 'sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his unquiet heart', 'as to postpone all intervening quest.', '', 'Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of', 'the Season-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then could enable her', 'commander to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and', 'then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial', 'Pacific in time to cruise there. Therefore, he must wait for the next', \"ensuing season. Yet the premature hour of the Pequod's sailing had,\", 'perhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this very', 'complexion of things. Because, an interval of three hundred and', 'sixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead', 'of impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous', 'hunt; if by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far', 'remote from his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his', 'wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China', 'Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his race. So that Monsoons,', 'Pampas, Nor-Westers, Harmattans, Traders; any wind but the Levanter', 'and Simoon, might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag', \"world-circle of the Pequod's circumnavigating wake.\", '', 'But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it', 'not but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one', 'solitary whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of', 'individual recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti', 'in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople? Yes. For the', 'peculiar snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could', 'not but be unmistakable. And have I not tallied the whale, Ahab would', 'mutter to himself, as after poring over his charts till long after', 'midnight he would throw himself back in reveries- tallied him, and', 'shall he escape? His broad fins are bored, and scalloped out like a', \"lost sheep's are! And here, his mad mind would run on in a breathless\", 'race; till a weariness and faintness of pondering came over him! and', 'in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover his', 'strength. Ah, God! what trances of torments does that man endure who', 'is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire. He sleeps with', 'clenched hands; and wakes with his own bloody nails in his palms.', '', 'Often, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably', 'vivid dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts', 'through the day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and', 'whirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain, till the', 'very throbbing of his life-spot became insufferable anguish; and', 'when, as was sometimes the case, these spiritual throes in him heaved', 'his being up from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from', 'which forked flames and lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends', 'beckoned him to leap down among them; when this hell in himself', 'yawned beneath him, a wild cry would be heard through the ship; and', 'with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state room, as though', 'escaping from a bed that was on fire. Yet these, perhaps, instead of', 'being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness, or fright', 'at his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens of its', 'intensity. For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly', 'steadfast hunter of the white whale; this Ahab that had gone to his', 'hammock, was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in', 'horror again. The latter was the eternal, living principle or soul in', 'him; and in sleep, being for the time dissociated from the', 'characterizing mind, which at other times employed it for its outer', 'vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching', 'contiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was no', 'longer an integral. But as the mind does not exist unless leagued', \"with the soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab's case,\", 'yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose;', 'that purpose, by its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself', 'against gods and devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent', 'being of its own. Nay, could grimly live and burn, while the common', 'vitality to which it was conjoined, fled horror-stricken from the', 'unbidden and unfathered birth. Therefore, the tormented spirit that', 'glared out of bodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab rushed from his', 'room, was for the time but a vacated thing, a formless somnambulistic', 'being, a ray of living light, to be sure, but without an object to', 'color, and therefore a blankness in itself.

In the instance where', 'three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and', 'I think it may have been something more than that; the man who darted', 'them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage', 'to Africa, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and', 'penetrated far into the interior, where he travelled for a period of', 'nearly two years, often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers,', 'poisonous miasmas, with all the other common perils incident to', 'wandering in the heart of unknown regions. Meanwhile, the whale he', 'had struck must also have been on its travels; no doubt it had thrice', 'circumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all the coasts of', 'Africa; but to no purpose. This man and this whale again came', 'together, and the one vanquished the other. I say I, myself, have', 'known three instances similar to this; that is in two of them I saw', 'the whales struck; and, upon the second attack, saw the two irons', 'with the respective marks cut in them, afterwards taken from the dead', 'fish. In the three-year instance, it so fell out that I was in the', 'boat both times, first and last, and the last time distinctly', \"recognized a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale's eye, which\", 'I had observed there three years previous. I say three years, but I', 'am pretty sure it was more than that.

Why such', 'a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to', 'his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for', 'however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be, they soon', 'put an end to his peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down', 'into a peculiarly valuable oil. No: the reason was this: that from', 'the fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige', 'of perilousness about such a whale as there did about Rinaldo', 'Rinaldini, insomuch that most fishermen were content to recognise him', 'by merely touching their tarpaulins when he would be discovered', 'lounging by them on the sea, without seeking to cultivate a more', 'intimate acquaintance.

But I should not much wonder if, in', 'the darkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after', 'all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from', 'beneath.', '', 'I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known', 'to me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In', 'more than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the', 'assailing boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself,', 'and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks. The', 'English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for', 'his strength, let me say, that there have been examples where the', 'lines attached to a running sperm whale have, in a calm, been', 'transferred to the ship, and secured there! the whale towing her', 'great hull through the water, as a horse walks off with a', 'cart. Again, it is very often observed that, if the sperm whale, once', 'struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often with', 'blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to his', 'pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his', 'character, that upon being attacked he will frequently open his', 'mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive', 'minutes. But I must be content with only one more and a concluding', 'illustration; a remarkable and most significant one, by which you', 'will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous event in', 'this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but that', 'these marvels (like all marvels) are mere repetitions of the ages; so', 'that for the millionth time we say amen with Solomon- Verily there is', 'nothing new under the sun.', '', 'In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian', 'magistrate of Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor', 'and Belisarius general. As many know, he wrote the history of his own', 'times, a work every way of uncommon value.

But as he', 'destroyed ships, as well as for other reasons, he must have been a', 'whale; and I am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale. And I will', 'tell you why. For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had been', 'always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep waters connecting', 'with it. Even now I am certain that those seas are not, and perhaps', 'never can be, in the present constitution of things, a place for his', 'habitual gregarious resort. But further investigations have recently', 'proved to me, that in modern times there have been isolated instances', 'of the presence of the sperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am told,', 'on good authority, that on the Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of', 'the British navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale. Now, as a', 'vessel of war readily passes through the Dardanelles, hence a sperm', 'whale could, by the same route, pass out of the Mediterranean into', 'the Propontis.', '', 'In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar', 'substance called brit is to be found, the aliment of the right', 'whale. But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm', 'whale- squid or cuttle-fish-lurks at the bottom of that sea, because', 'large creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been', 'found at its surface.  If, then, you properly put these statements', 'together, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that,', \"according to all human reasoning, Procopius's sea-monster, that for\", 'half a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all', 'probability have been a sperm whale.', '', 'The following are extracts from Chace\\'s narrative: \"Every fact seemed', 'to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which', 'directed his operations; he made two several attacks upon the ship,', 'at a short interval between them, both of which, according to their', 'direction, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being made', 'ahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the', 'shock; to effect which, the exact manoeuvres which he made were', 'necessary. His aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated', 'resentment and fury.

She has a \"Gam,\" a thing so', 'utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name', 'even; and if by chance they should hear of it, they only grin at it,', 'and repeat gamesome stuff about \"spouters\" and \"blubber-boilers,\" and', 'such like pretty exclamations. Why it is that all Merchant-seamen,', \"and also all Pirates and Man-of-War's men, and Slave-ship sailors,\", 'cherish such a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a', 'question it would be hard to answer. Because, in the case of pirates,', 'say, I should like to know whether that profession of theirs has any', 'peculiar glory about it. It sometimes ends in uncommon elevation,', 'indeed; but only at the gallows. And besides, when a man is elevated', 'in that odd fashion, he has no proper foundation for his superior', 'altitude. Hence, I conclude, that in boasting himself to be high', 'lifted above a whaleman, in that assertion the pirate has no solid', 'basis to stand on.', '', 'But what is a Gam? You might wear out your index-finger running up', 'and down the columns of dictionaries, and never find the word,', \"Dr. Johnson never attained to that erudition; Noah Webster's ark does\", 'not hold it. Nevertheless, this same expressive word has now for many', 'years been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born', 'Yankees.

All professions have their own little peculiarities', 'of detail; so has the whale fishery. In a pirate, man-of-war, or', 'slave ship, when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always', 'sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat', \"there, and often steers himself with a pretty little milliner's\", 'tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons. But the whale-boat has', 'no seat astern, no sofa of that sort whatever, and no tiller at', 'all. High times indeed, if whaling captains were wheeled about the', 'water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs. And as for', 'a tiller, the whale-boat never admits of any such effeminacy; and', \"therefore as in gamming a complete boat's crew must leave the ship,\", 'and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number, that', 'subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion, and the captain,', 'having no place to sit in, is pulled off to his visit all standing', 'like a pine tree. And often you will notice that being conscious of', 'the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of', 'the two ships, this standing captain is all alive to the importance', 'of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs. Nor is this any', 'very easy matter; for in his rear is the immense projecting steering', 'oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back, the after-oar', 'reciprocating by rapping his knees in front. He is thus completely', 'wedged before and behind, and can only expand himself sideways by', 'settling down on his stretched legs; but a sudden, violent pitch of', 'the boat will often go far to topple him, because length of', 'foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth. Merely make a', 'spread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up. Then, again,', \"it would never do in plain sight of the world's riveted eyes, it\", 'would never do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen', 'steadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything', 'with his hands; indeed, as token of his entire, buoyant self-command,', \"he generally carries his hands in his trowsers' pockets; but perhaps\", 'being generally very large, heavy hands, he carries them there for', 'ballast.

For in their interflowing', 'aggregate, those grand fresh-water seas of ours,- Erie, and Ontario,', 'and Huron, and Superior, and Michigan,- possess an ocean-like', \"expansiveness, with many of the ocean's noblest traits; with many of\", 'its rimmed varieties of races and of climes. They contain round', 'archipelagoes of romantic isles, even as the Polynesian waters do; in', 'large part, are shored by two great contrasting nations, as the', 'Atlantic is; they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous', 'territorial colonies from the East, dotted all round their banks;', 'here and there are frowned upon by batteries, and by the goat-like', 'craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw; they have heard the fleet thunderings', 'of naval victories; at intervals, they yield their beaches to wild', 'barbarians, whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry', 'wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered', 'forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in', 'Gothic genealogies; those same woods harboring wild Afric beasts of', 'prey, and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar', 'Emperors; they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland, as', 'well as Winnebago villages; they float alike the full-rigged merchant', 'ship, the armed cruiser of the State, the steamer, and the beech', 'canoe; they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as direful as', 'any that lash the salted wave; they know what shipwrecks are, for out', 'of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned full many a', 'midnight ship with all its shrieking crew. Thus, gentlemen, though an', 'inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean nurtured; as', 'much of an audacious mariner as any. And for Radney, though in his', 'infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket beach, to', 'nurse at his maternal sea; though in after life he had long followed', 'our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was he quite', 'as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman, fresh', 'from the latitudes of buckhorn handled Bowie-knives.

Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed', 'Radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated', 'state, I know not; but so it happened. Intolerably striding along the', 'deck, the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the', 'planks, and also a shovel, and remove some offensive matters', 'consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large.', '', '\"Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship\\'s deck at sea is a piece of', 'household work which in all times but raging gales is regularly', 'attended to every evening; it has been known to be done in the case', 'of ships actually foundering at the time.

But in all vessels this broom business is the', 'prescriptive province of the boys, if boys there be aboard. Besides,', 'it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho that had been divided into', 'gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being the most athletic seaman', 'of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of', 'the gangs; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial', 'business not connected with truly nautical duties, such being the', 'case with his comrades. I mention all these particulars so that you', 'may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men.', '', '\"But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost', 'as plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had', 'spat in his face. Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will', 'understand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman', 'fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command. But as he sat', \"still for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate's\", 'malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in', 'him and the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he', 'instinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and', 'unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already', 'ireful being- a repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really', 'valiant men even when aggrieved- this nameless phantom feeling,', 'gentlemen, stole over Steelkilt.', '', '\"Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily', 'exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that', 'sweeping the deck was not his business, and he would not do it. And', 'then, without at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three', 'lads, as the customary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the', 'pumps, had done little or nothing all day. To this, Radney replied,', 'with an oath, in a most domineering and outrageous manner', 'unconditionally reiterating his command; meanwhile advancing upon the', \"still seated Lakeman, with an unlifted cooper's club hammer which he\", 'had snatched from a cask near by.', '', '\"Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps,', 'for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating', 'Steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow', 'still smothering the conflagration within him, without speaking he', 'remained doggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed', 'Radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously', 'commanding him to do his bidding.', '', '\"Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windless, steadily', 'followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated', 'his intention not to obey.

In fact, as the great Hunter says, the\", 'mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully', 'invested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that', 'so roundingly envelopes it.

This fin has four regular bone-fingers, the index, middle,', 'ring, and little finger. But all these are permanently lodged in', 'their fleshy covering, as the human fingers in an artificial', 'covering.  \"However recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us,\"', 'said humorous Stubb one day, \"he can never be truly said to handle us', 'without mittens.\"', '', 'For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must', 'needs conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the', 'world which much remain unpainted to the last. True, one portrait may', 'hit the mark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with any', 'very considerable degree of exactness. So there is no earthly way of', 'finding out precisely what the whale really looks like. And the only', 'mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living', 'contour, is by going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run no', 'small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him. Wherefore, it', 'seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity', 'touching this Leviathan.', '', '', '', '', 'Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales and the True Pictures of', 'Whaling Scenes', '', '', 'In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly', 'tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them', 'which are to be found in certain books, both ancient and modern,', 'especially in Pliny, Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, &amp;c. But I', 'pass that matter by.', '', 'I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale;', \"Colnett's, Huggins's, Frederick Cuvier's, and Beale's.

His frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm', 'Whales, though no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of', 'some parlor men, is admirably correct and life-like in its general', 'effect.  Some of the Sperm Whale drawings in J. Ross Browne are', 'pretty correct in contour; but they are wretchedly engraved. That is', 'not his fault though.', '', 'Of the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in Scoresby; but', 'they are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable', 'impression. He has but one picture of whaling scenes, and this is a', 'sad deficiency, because it is by such pictures only, when at all well', 'done, that you can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living', 'whale as seen by his living hunters.', '', 'But, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details', 'not the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to', 'be anywhere found, are two large French engravings, well executed,', 'and taken from paintings by one Garnery. Respectively, they represent', 'attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale. In the first engraving a noble', 'Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might, just risen beneath', 'the boat from the profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in', 'the. air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks. The', 'prow of the boat is partially unbroken, and is drawn just balancing', \"upon the monster's spine; and standing in that prow, for that one\", 'single incomputable flash of time, you behold an oarsman, half', 'shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale, and in the act', 'of leaping, as if from a precipice. The action of the whole thing is', 'wonderfully good and true. The half-emptied line-tub floats on the', 'whitened sea; the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob', 'in it; the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about the whale', 'in contrasting expressions of affright; while in the black stormy', 'distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene. Serious fault might', 'be found with the anatomical details of this whale, but let that', 'pass; since, for the life of me, I could not draw so good a one.', '', 'In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside', 'the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his', 'black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the', 'Patagonian cliffs. His jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so', 'that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there', 'must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below. Sea fowls', 'are pecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, and other sea candies and', 'maccaroni, which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent', 'back. And all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through', 'the deep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake, and', 'causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught', 'nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer. Thus, the fore-ground is', 'all raging commotion; but behind, in admirable artistic contrast, is', 'the glassy level of a sea becalmed, the drooping unstarched sails of', 'the powerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead whale, a conquered', 'fortress, with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the inserted', 'into his spout-hole.', '', 'Who Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he', 'was either practically conversant with his subject, or else', 'marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman. The French are the', 'lads for painting action. Go and gaze upon all the paintings of', 'Europe, and where will you find such a gallery of living and', 'breathing commotion on canvas, as in that triumphal hall at', 'Versailles; where the beholder fights his way, pell-mell, through the', 'consecutive great battles of France; where every sword seems a flash', 'of the Northern Lights, and the successive armed kings and Emperors', 'dash by, like a charge of crowned centaurs? Not wholly unworthy of a', 'place in that gallery, are these sea battle-pieces of Garnery.', '', 'The natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of', 'things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and', 'engravings they have of their whaling scenes. With not one tenth of', \"England's experience in the fishery, and not the thousandth part of\", 'that of the Americans, they have nevertheless furnished both nations', 'with the only finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real', 'spirit of the whale hunt. For the most part, the English and American', 'whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the', 'mechanical outline of things, such as the vacant profile of the', 'whale; which, so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned, is', 'about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid. Even', 'Scoresby, the justly renowned Right whaleman, after giving us a stiff', 'full length of the Greenland whale, and three or four delicate', 'miniatures of narwhales and porpoises, treats us to a series of', 'classical engravings of boat hooks, chopping knives, and grapnels;', 'and with the microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the', 'inspection of a shivering world ninety-six fac-similes of magnified', 'Arctic snow crystals. I mean no disparagement to the excellent', 'voyager (I honor him for a veteran), but in so important a matter it', 'was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a', 'sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of the Peace.', '', 'In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there are two', 'other French engravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes', 'himself \"H.

The other engraving is quite a different affair: the ship', 'hove-to upon the open sea, and in the very heart of the Leviathanic', 'life, with a Right Whale alongside; the vessel (in the act of', 'cutting-in) hove over to the monster as if to a quay; and a boat,', 'hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity, is about giving', 'chase to whales in the distance. The harpoons and lances lie levelled', 'for use; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole; while', 'from a sudden roll of the ship, the little craft stands half-erect', 'out of the water, like a rearing horse. From that ship, the smoke of', 'the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke over a', 'village of smithies; and to windward, a black cloud, rising up with', 'earnest of squalls and rains, seems to quicken the activity of the', 'excited seamen.', '', '', '', '', 'Of Whales in Paint; in Teeth; in Wood; in Sheet-Iron; in Stone; in', 'Mountains; in Stars', '', '', 'On Tower-hill, as you go down to the London docks, you may have seen', 'a crippled beggar (or kedger, as the sailors say) holding a painted', 'board before him, representing the tragic scene in which he lost his', 'leg.

Haul in!\" cried Starbuck again; \"he\\'s rising.\"', '', \"The lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand's breadth\", 'could have been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all', 'dripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water within two', \"ship's length of the hunters.\", '', 'His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In most land', 'animals there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their', 'veins, whereby when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least', 'instantly shut off in certain directions. Not so with the whale; one', 'of whose peculiarities it is, to have an entire non-valvular', 'structure of the blood-vessels, so that when pierced even by so small', 'a point as a harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole', 'arterial system; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary', 'pressure of water at a great distance below the surface, his life may', 'be said to pour from him in incessant streams. Yet so vast is the', 'quantity of blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior', 'fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a', 'considerable period; even as in a drought a river will flow, whose', 'source is the well-springs of far-off and indiscernible hills. Even', 'now, when the boats pulled upon this whale, and perilously drew over', 'his swaying flukes, and the lances were darted into him, they were', 'followed by steady jets from the new made wound, which kept', 'continually playing, while the natural spout-hole in his head was', 'only at intervals, however rapid, sending its affrighted moisture', 'into the air. From this last vent no blood yet came, because no vital', 'part of him had thus far been struck. His life, as they significantly', 'call it, was untouched.', '', 'As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of', 'his form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly', 'revealed.

Still rolling in his blood, at last', 'he partially disclosed a strangely discolored bunch or protuberance,', 'the size of a bushel, low down on the flank.', '', '\"A nice spot,\" cried Flask; \"just let me prick him there once.\"', '', '\"Avast!\" cried Starbuck, \"there\\'s no need of that!\"', '', 'But humane Starbuck was too late. At the instant of the dart an', 'ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more', 'than sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with', 'swift fury blindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their', \"glorying crews all over with showers of gore, capsizing Flask's boat\", 'and marring the bows. It was his death stroke. For, by this time, so', 'spent was he by loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from', 'the wreck he had made; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped', 'with his stumped fin, then over and over slowly revolved like a', 'waning world; turned up the white secrets of his belly; lay like a', 'log, and died. It was most piteous, that last expiring spout. As when', 'by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some mighty', 'fountain, and with half-stifled melancholy gurglings the spray-column', 'lowers and lowers to the ground- so the last long dying spout of the', 'whale.', '', 'Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body', 'showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures', \"unrifled. Immediately, by Starbuck's orders, lines were secured to it\", 'at different points, so that ere long every boat was a buoy; the', 'sunken whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the', 'cords. By very heedful management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale', 'was transferred to her side, and was strongly secured there by the', 'stiffest fluke-chains, for it was plain that unless artificially', 'upheld, the body would at once sink to the bottom.', '', 'It so chanced that almost upon first him with the spade, the entire', 'length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh, on the', 'lower part of the bunch before described. But as the stumps of', 'harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales,', 'with the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no prominence of any', 'kind to denote their place; therefore, there must needs have been', 'some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for', 'the ulceration alluded to. But still more curious was the fact of a', 'lance-head of stone being found in him, not far from the buried iron,', 'the flesh perfectly firm about it. Who had darted that stone lance?', \"And when? It might have been darted by some Nor' West Indian long\", 'before America was discovered.', '', 'What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous', 'cabinet there is no telling. But a sudden stop was put to further', \"discoveries, by the ship's being unprecedentedly dragged over\", \"sideways to the sea, owing to the body's immensely increasing\", 'tendency to sink. However, Starbuck, who had the ordering of affairs,', 'hung on to it to the last; hung on to it so resolutely, indeed, that', 'when at length the ship would have been capsized, if still persisting', 'in locking arms with the body; then, when the command was given to', 'break clear from it, such was the immovable strain upon the', 'timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and cables were fastened, that', 'it was impossible to cast them off.  Meantime everything in the', 'Pequod was aslant. To cross to the other side of the deck was like', 'walking up the steep gabled roof of a house. The ship groaned and', 'gasped. Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were', 'started from their places, by the unnatural dislocation. In vain', 'handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable', 'fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timberheads; and so low had', 'the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all', 'approached, while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added', 'to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on the point of going over.', '', '\"Hold on, hold on, won\\'t ye?\" cried Stubb to the body, \"don\\'t be in', 'such a devil of a hurry to sink!

No use prying there; avast, I say with your', 'handspikes, and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and', 'cut the big chains.\"', '', '\"Knife? Aye, aye,\" cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter\\'s heavy', 'hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began', 'slashing at the largest fluke-chains.

With', 'a terrific snap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted, the', 'carcase sank.', '', 'Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm', 'Whale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately', 'accounted for it. Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great', 'buoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the', 'surface. If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and', 'broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their', 'bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert', 'that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the', 'fish so sinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in', 'him. But it is not so. For young whales, in the highest health, and', 'swelling with noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm', 'flush and May of life, with all their panting lard about them! even', 'these brawny, buoyant heroes do sometimes sink.', '', 'Be it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this', 'accident than any other species. Where one of that sort go down,', 'twenty Right Whales do. This difference in the species is no doubt', 'imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the', 'Right Whale; his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a', 'ton; from this incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free. But there', 'are instances where, after the lapse of many hours or several days,', 'the sunken whale again rises, more buoyant than in life.  But the', 'reason of this is obvious. Gases are generated in him; he swells to a', 'prodigious magnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon. A', 'line-of-battle ship could hardly keep him under then. In the Shore', 'Whaling, on soundings, among the Bays of New Zealand, when a Right', 'Whale gives token of sinking, they fasten buoys to him, with plenty', 'of rope; so that when the body has gone down, they know where to look', 'for it when it shall have ascended again.', '', 'It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard', \"from the Pequod's mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again\", 'lowering her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a', 'Fin-Back, belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of', \"its incredible power of swimming.

Besides, it has been divined by other continental', 'commentators, that when Jonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa', 'ship, he straightway effected his escape to another vessel near by,', 'some vessel with a whale for a figure-head; and, I would add,', 'possibly called \"The Whale,\" as some craft are nowadays christened', 'the \"Shark,\" the \"Gull,\" the \"Eagle.\" Nor have there been wanting', 'learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned in the', 'book of Jonah merely meant a life-preserver- an inflated bag of wind-', 'which the endangered prophet swam to, and so was saved from a watery', 'doom. Poor Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all round. But he had', 'still another reason for his want of faith. It was this, if I', 'remember right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean', \"Sea, and after three days' he was vomited up somewhere within three\", \"days' journey of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much more than\", \"three days' journey across from the nearest point of the\", 'Mediterranean coast. How is that?', '', 'But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within', 'that short distance of Nineveh? Yes. He might have carried him round', 'by the way of the Cape of Good Hope.

For by a Portuguese Catholic priest, this very idea of', \"Jonah's going to Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a\", 'signal magnification of the general miracle. And so it was.  Besides,', 'to this day, the highly enlightened Turks devoutly believe in the', 'historical story of Jonah. And some three centuries ago, an English', \"traveller in old Harris's Voyages, speaks of a Turkish Mosque built\", 'in honor of Jonah, in which Mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt', 'without any oil.', '', '', '', '', 'Pitchpoling', '', '', 'To make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages are', 'anointed; and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform an', 'analogous operation upon their boat; they grease the bottom. Nor is', 'it to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm, it may', 'possibly be of no contemptible advantage; considering that oil and', 'water are hostile; that oil is a sliding thing, and that the object', 'in view is to make the boat slide bravely.  Queequeg believed', 'strongly in anointing his boat, and one morning not long after the', 'German ship Jungfrau disappeared, took more than customary pains in', 'that occupation; crawling under its bottom, where it hung over the', 'side, and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to', \"insure a crop of hair from the craft's bald keel. He seemed to be\", 'working in obedience to some particular presentiment. Nor did it', 'remain unwarranted by the event.', '', 'Towards noon whales were raised; but so soon as the ship sailed down', 'to them, they turned and fled with swift precipitancy; a disordered', \"flight, as of Cleopatra's barges from Actium.\", '', \"Nevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubb's was foremost. By great\", 'exertion, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but the', 'stricken whale, without at all sounding, still continued his', 'horizontal flight, with added fleetness. Such unintermitted', 'strainings upon the planted iron must sooner or later inevitably', 'extract it. It became imperative to lance the flying whale, or be', 'content to lose him. But to haul the boat up to his flank was', 'impossible, he swam so fast and furious. What then remained?', '', 'Of all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of hand and', 'countless subtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often', 'forced, none exceed that fine manoeuvre with the lance called', 'pitchpoling. Small sword, or broad sword, in all its exercises boasts', 'nothing like it. It is only indispensable with an inveterate running', 'whale; its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which', 'the long lance is accurately darted from a violently rocking, jerking', 'boat, under extreme headway. Steel and wood included, the entire', 'spear is some ten or twelve feet in length; the staff is much', 'slighter than that of the harpoon, and also of a lighter material-', 'pine. It is furnished with a small rope called a warp, of', 'considerable length, by which it can be hauled back to the hand after', 'darting.', '', 'But before going further, it is important to mention here, that', 'though the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance,', 'yet it is seldom done; and when done, is still less frequently', 'successful, on account of the greater weight and inferior length of', 'the harpoon as compared with the lance, which in effect become', 'serious drawbacks. As a general thing, therefore, you must first get', 'to a whale, before any pitchpoling comes into play.', '', 'Look now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness', 'and equanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to', 'excel in pitchpoling. Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed', 'bow of the flying boat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is', 'forty feet ahead. Handling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or', 'thrice along its length to see if it be exactly straight, Stubb', 'whistlingly gathers up the coil of the wrap in one hand, so as to', 'secure its free end in his grasp, leaving the rest unobstructed. Then', \"holding the lance full before his waistband's middle, he levels it at\", 'the whale; when, covering him with it, he steadily depresses the', 'butt-end in his hand, thereby elevating the point till the weapon', 'stands fairly balanced upon his palm, fifteen feet in the air. He', 'minds you somewhat of a juggler, balancing a long staff on his chin.', 'Next moment with a rapid, nameless impulse, in a superb arch the', 'bright steel spans the foaming distance, and quivers in the life spot', 'of the whale. Instead of sparkling water, he now spouts red blood.', '', '\"That drove the spigot out of him!\" cried Stubb. \"\\'Tis July\\'s', 'immortal Fourth; all fountains must run wine today! Would now, it', 'were old Orleans whiskey, or old Ohio, or unspeakable old', \"Monongahela! Then, Tashtego, lad, I'd have ye hold a canakin to the\", \"jet, and we'd drink round it!

The agonized whale goes into his flurry; the tow-line', 'is slackened, and the pitchpoler dropping astern, folds his hands,', 'and mutely watches the monster die.', '', '', '', '', 'The Fountain', '', '', 'That for six thousand years- and no one knows how many millions of', 'ages before- the great whales should have been spouting all over the', 'sea, and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with', 'so many sprinkling or mistifying pots; and that for some centuries', 'back, thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of', 'the whale, watching these sprinklings and spoutings- that all this', 'should be, and yet, that down to this blessed minute (fifteen and a', \"quarter minutes past one o'clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of\", 'December, A.D. 1851), it should still remain a problem, whether these', 'spoutings are, after all, really water, or nothing but vapor- this is', 'surely a noteworthy thing.', '', 'Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items', 'contingent. Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their', 'gills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times', 'is combined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or', 'a cod might live a century, and never once raise its head above the', 'surface.  But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him', \"regular lungs, like a human being's, the whale can only live by\", 'inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere.  Wherefore the', 'necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world. But he cannot', 'in any degree breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary', \"attitude, the Sperm Whale's mouth is buried at least eight feet\", 'beneath the surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no', 'connexion with his mouth. No, he breathes through his spiracle alone;', 'and this is on the top of his head.', '', 'If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function', 'indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a', 'certain element, which being subsequently brought into contact with', 'the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, I do not', 'think I shall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous', 'scientific words. Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in', 'a man could be aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his', 'nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time. That is to', 'say, he would then live without breathing. Anomalous as it may seem,', 'this is precisely the case with the whale, who systematically lives,', 'by intervals, his full hour and more (when at the bottom) without', 'drawing a single breath, or so much as in any way inhaling a particle', 'of air; for, remember, he has no gills. How is this? Between his ribs', 'and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable', 'involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels,', 'when he quits the surface, are completely distended with oxygenated', 'blood. So that for an hour or more, a thousand fathoms in the sea, he', 'carries a surplus stock of vitality in him, just as the camel', 'crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink for', 'future use in its four supplementary stomachs. The anatomical fact of', 'this labyrinth is indisputable; and that the supposition founded upon', 'it is reasonable and true, seems the more cogent to me, when I', 'consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in', 'having his spoutings out, as the fishermen phrase it. This is what I', 'mean. If unmolested, upon rising to the surface, the Sperm Whale will', 'continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his', 'other unmolested risings. Say he stays eleven minutes, and jets', 'seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then whenever he', 'rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again,', 'to a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him, so', 'that he sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good his', 'regular allowance of air. And not till those seventy breaths are', 'told, will he finally go down to stay out his full term', 'below. Remark, however, that in different individuals these rates are', 'different; but in any one they are alike. Now, why should the whale', 'thus insist upon having his spoutings out, unless it be to replenish', 'his reservoir of air, ere descending for good? How obvious it is too,', \"that this necessity for the whale's rising exposes him to all the\", 'fatal hazards of the chase. And not by hook or by net could this vast', 'leviathan be caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the', 'sunlight. Not so much thy skill, then, O hunter, as the great', 'necessities that strike the victory to thee!', '', 'In man, breathing is incessantly going on- one breath only serving', 'for two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has', 'to attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he', 'will. But the Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday', 'of his time.', '', 'It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole;', 'if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water,', 'then I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of', 'smell seems obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at', 'all answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so', 'clogged with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power', 'of smelling. But owing to the mystery of the spout- whether it be', 'water or whether it be vapor- no absolute certainty can as yet be', 'arrived at on this head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm', 'Whale has no proper olfactories. But what does he want of them? No', 'roses, no violets, no Cologne-water in the sea.', '', 'Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his', 'spouting canal, and as that long canal- like the grand Erie Canal- is', 'furnished with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward', 'retention of air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the', 'whale has no voice; unless you insult him by saying, that when he so', 'strangely rumbles, he talks through his nose. But then again, what', 'has the whale to say? Seldom have I known any profound being that had', 'anything to say to this world, unless forced to stammer out something', 'by way of getting a living. Oh! happy that the world is such an', 'excellent listener!', '', 'Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is', 'for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,', 'horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a', 'little to one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe', 'laid down in a city on one side of a street. But the question returns', 'whether this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether', 'the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath,', 'or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the', 'mouth, and discharged through the spiracle. It is certain that the', 'mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but it cannot', 'be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through', 'the spiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem', 'to be, when in feeding he accidentally takes in water.  But the Sperm', \"Whale's food is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout\", 'even if he would. Besides, if you regard him very closely, and time', 'him with your watch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an', 'undeviating rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary', 'periods of respiration.', '', 'But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out!', 'You have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not', 'tell water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to', 'settle these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the', 'knottiest of all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand', 'in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.', '', 'The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist', 'enveloping it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls', 'from it, when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a', 'close view of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water', 'cascading all around him. And if at such times you should think that', 'you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know', 'that they are not merely condensed from its vapor; or how do you know', 'that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the', 'spout-hole fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the', \"whale's head? For even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day\", \"sea in a calm, with his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary's in\", 'the desert; even then, the whale always carries a small basin of', 'water on his head, as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a', 'cavity in a rock filled up with rain.', '', 'Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching', 'the precise nature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be', 'peering into it, and putting his face in it. You cannot go with your', 'pitcher to this fountain and fill it, and bring it away. For even', 'when coming into slight contact with the outer, vapory shreds of the', 'jet, which will often happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from', 'the acridness of the thing so touching it. And I know one, who coming', 'into still closer contact with the spout, whether with some', 'scientific object in view, or otherwise, I cannot say, the skin', 'peeled off from his cheek and arm. Wherefore, among whalemen, the', 'spout is deemed poisonous; they try to evade it.  Another thing; I', 'have heard it said, and I do not much doubt it, that if the jet is', 'fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you. The wisest thing', 'the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is to let this deadly', 'spout alone.', '', 'Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. My', 'hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides', 'other reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations', 'touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale;', 'I account him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an', 'undisputed fact that he is never found on soundings, or near shores;', 'all other whales sometimes are. He is both ponderous and', 'profound. And I am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous', 'profound beings, such as Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante,', 'and so on, there always goes up a certain semi-visible steam, while', 'in the act of thinking deep thoughts. While composing a little', 'treatise on Eternity, I had the curiosity to place a mirror before', 'me; and ere long saw reflected there, a curious involved worming and', 'undulation in the atmosphere over my head. The invariable moisture of', 'my hair, while plunged in deep thought, after six cups of hot tea in', 'my thin shingled attic, of an August noon; this seems an additional', 'argument for the above supposition.', '', 'And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to', 'behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast,', 'mild head overhung by a canopy of vapor, engendered by his', 'incommunicable contemplations, and that vapor- as you will sometimes', 'see it- glorified by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal', \"upon his thoughts. For d'ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear air;\", 'they only irradiate vapor.  And so, through all the thick mists of', 'the dim doubts in my mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot,', 'enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray. And for this I thank God; for', 'all have doubts; many deny; but doubts or denials, few along with', 'them, have intuitions.  Doubts of all things earthly, and intuitions', 'of some things heavenly; this combination makes neither believer nor', 'infidel, but makes a man who regards them both with equal eye.', '', '', '', '', 'The Tail', '', '', 'Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope,', 'and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less', 'celestial, I celebrate a tail.', '', \"Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale's tail to begin at that point\", 'of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it', 'comprises upon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty', 'square feet. The compact round body of its root expands into two', 'broad, firm, flat palms or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less', 'than an inch in thickness. At the crotch or junction, these flukes', 'slightly overlap, then sideways recede from each other like wings,', 'leaving a wide vacancy between. In no living thing are the lines of', 'beauty more exquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders of', 'these flukes.  At its utmost expansion in the full grown whale, the', 'tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across.', '', 'The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut', 'into it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:- upper,', 'middle, and lower. The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are long', 'and horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running', 'crosswise between the outside layers. This triune structure, as much', 'as anything else, imparts power to the tail. To the student of old', 'Roman walls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the', 'thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those', 'wonderful relics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so', 'much to the great strength of the masonry.', '', 'But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not', 'enough, the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and', 'woof of muscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side', 'the loins and running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with', 'them, and largely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the', 'confluent measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to', 'a point. Could annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to', 'do it.', '', 'Nor does this- its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the', 'graceful flexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease', 'undulates through a Titanism of power. On the contrary, those motions', 'derive their most appalling beauty from it. Real strength never', 'impairs beauty or harmony, but it often bestows it; and in everything', 'imposingly beautiful, strength has much to do with the magic. Take', 'away the tied tendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in', 'the carved Hercules, and its charm would be gone. As devout Eckerman', 'lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of Goethe, he was', 'overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man, that seemed as a Roman', 'triumphal arch.

It', 'never wriggles. In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of', 'inferiority. To the whale his tail is the sole means of propulsion.', 'Scroll-wise coiled forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung', 'backwards, it is this which gives that singular darting, leaping', 'motion to the monster when furiously swimming. His side-fins only', 'serve to steer by.', '', 'Second: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only', 'fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in', 'his conflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his', 'tail. In striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from', 'it, and the blow is only inflicted by the recoil. If it be made in', 'the unobstructed air, especially if it descend to its mark, the', 'stroke is then simply irresistible. No ribs of man or boat can', 'withstand it. Your only salvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes', 'sideways through the opposing water, then partly owing to the light', 'buoyancy of the whale-boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a', 'cracked rib or a dashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side,', 'is generally the most serious result. These submerged side blows are', 'so often received in the fishery, that they are accounted mere', \"child's play.  Some one strips off a frock, and the hole is stopped.\", '', 'Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale', 'the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect', 'there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the', \"elephant's trunk. This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of\", 'sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft', 'slowness moves his immense flukes side to side upon the surface of', \"the sea; and if he feel but a sailor's whisker, woe to that sailor,\", 'whiskers and all. What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch!', 'Had this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me', \"of Darmonodes' elephant that so frequented the flower-market, and\", 'with low salutations presented nosegays to damsels, and then caressed', 'their zones. On more accounts than one, a pity it is that the whale', 'does not possess this prehensile virtue in his tail; for I have heard', 'of yet another elephant, that when wounded in the fight, curved round', 'his trunk and extracted the dart.', '', 'Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of', 'the middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast', 'corpulence of his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as', 'if it were a hearth. But still you see his power in his play. The', 'broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air! then smiting', 'the surface, the thunderous concussion resounds for miles. You would', 'almost think a great gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the', 'light wreath of vapor from the spiracle at his other extremity, you', 'would think that that was the smoke from the touch-hole.', '', 'Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the', 'flukes lies considerably below the level of his back, they are then', 'completely out of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to', 'plunge into the deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of', 'his body are tossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a', 'moment, till they downwards shoot out of view. Excepting the sublime', \"breach- somewhere else to be described- this peaking of the whale's\", 'flukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated', 'nature. Out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems', 'spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven. So in dreams, have I', 'seen majestic Satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from', 'the flame Baltic of Hell. But in gazing at such scenes, it is all in', 'all what mood you are in; if in the Dantean, the devils will occur to', 'you; if in that of Isaiah, the archangels. Standing at the mast-head', 'of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a', 'large herd of whales in the east, all heading towards the sun, and', 'for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes. As it seemed to', 'me at the time, such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods was', 'never beheld, even in Persia, the home of the fire worshippers. As', 'Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African elephant, I then', 'testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most devout of all', 'beings. For according to King Juba, the military elephants of', 'antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the', 'profoundest silence.', '', 'The chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the', 'elephant, so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk', 'of the other are concerned, should not tend to place those two', 'opposite organs on an equality, much less the creatures to which they', 'respectively belong. For as the mightiest elephant is but a terror to', \"Leviathan, so, compared with Leviathan's tail, his trunk is but the\", \"stalk of a lily. The most direful blow from the elephant's trunk were\", 'as the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush and', \"crash of the sperm whale's ponderous flukes, which in repeated\", 'instances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their', 'oars and crews into the air, very much as an Indian juggler tosses', 'his balls.', '', 'The more I consider this mighty tail, the more do I deplore my', 'inability to express it.  At times there are gestures in it, which,', 'though they would well grace the hand of man, remain wholly', 'inexplicable. In an extensive herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are', 'these mystic gestures, that I have heard hunters who have declared', 'them akin to Free-Mason signs and symbols; that the whale, indeed, by', 'these methods intelligently conversed with the world. Nor are there', 'wanting other motions of the whale in his general body, full of', 'strangeness, and unaccountable to his most experienced', 'assailant. Dissect him how I may, then, I but go skin deep. I know', 'him not, and never will. But if I know not even the tail of this', 'whale, how understand his head? much more, how comprehend his face,', 'when face he has none? Thou shalt see my back parts, my tail, he', 'seems to say, but my face shall not be seen.

So that did you carry them the news that another flood', 'had come; they would only answer- \"Well, boys, here\\'s the ark!\"', '', 'Now, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of', 'Java, in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most', 'of the ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen', 'as an excellent spot for cruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained', 'more and more upon Java Head, the look-outs were repeatedly hailed,', 'and admonished to keep wide awake. But though the green palmy cliffs', 'of the land soon loomed on the starboard bow, and with delighted', 'nostrils the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air, yet not a single', 'jet was descried.

To this', 'aggregation of the Sperm Whale into such immense caravans, may be', 'imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds, you', 'may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together, without being', 'greeted by a single spout; and then be suddenly saluted by what', 'sometimes seems thousands on thousands.', '', 'Broad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and', 'forming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon,', 'a continuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the', 'noon-day air. Unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the', 'Right Whale, which, dividing at top, fall over in two branches, like', 'the cleft drooping boughs of a willow, the single forward-slanting', 'spout of the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist,', 'continually rising and falling away to leeward.', '', \"Seen from the Pequod's deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill\", 'of the sea, this host of vapory spouts, individually curling up into', 'the air, and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze,', 'showed like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis,', 'descried of a balmy autumnal morning, by some horseman on a height.', '', 'As marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains,', 'accelerate their march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage', 'in their rear, and once more expand in comparative security upon the', 'plain; even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying', 'forward through the straits; gradually contracting the wings of their', 'semicircle, and swimming on, in one solid, but still crescentic', 'centre.', '', 'Crowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers', 'handling their weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their', 'yet suspended boats. If the wind only held, little doubt had they,', 'that chased through these Straits of Sunda, the vast host would only', 'deploy into the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of', 'their number. And who could tell whether, in that congregated', 'caravan, Moby Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like', 'the worshipped white-elephant in the coronation procession of the', 'Siamese! So with stun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along,', 'driving these leviathans before us; when, of a sudden, the voice of', 'Tashtego was heard, loudly directing attention to something in our', 'wake.', '', 'Corresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in the', 'rear. It seemed formed of detached white vapors, rising and falling', 'something like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so', 'completely come and go; for they constantly hovered, without finally', 'disappearing.

As with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced', 'the deck; in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and', 'in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him; some such', 'fancy as the above seemed his. And when he glanced upon the green', 'walls of the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing, and', 'bethought him that through that gate lay the route to his vengeance,', 'and beheld, how that through that same gate he was now both chasing', 'and being chased to his deadly end; and not only that, but a herd of', 'remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were', 'infernally cheering him on with their curses;- when all these', \"conceits had passed through his brain, Ahab's brow was left gaunt and\", 'ribbed, like the black sand beach after some stormy tide had been', 'gnawing it, without being able to drag the firm thing from its place.', '', 'But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and', 'when, after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the', 'Pequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra', 'side, emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the', 'harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been', 'gaining upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so', 'victoriously gained upon the Malays. But still driving on in the wake', 'of the whales, at length they seemed abating their speed; gradually', 'the ship neared them; and the wind now dying away, word was passed to', 'spring to the boats. But no sooner did the herd, by some presumed', 'wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale, become notified of the three', 'keels that were after them,- though as yet a mile in their rear,-', 'than they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and battalions,', 'so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked', 'bayonets, moved on with redoubled velocity.', '', 'Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and', \"after several hours' pulling were almost disposed to renounce the\", 'chase, when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave', 'animating tokens that they were now at last under the influence of', 'that strange perplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the', 'fishermen perceive it in the whale, they say he is gallied. The', 'compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and', 'steadily swimming, were now broken up in one measureless rout; and', \"like King Porus' elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander, they\", 'seemed going mad with consternation. In all directions expanding in', 'vast irregular circles, and aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by', 'their short thick spoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction', 'of panic. This was still more strangely evinced by those of their', 'number, who, completely paralysed as it were, helplessly floated like', 'water-logged dismantled ships on the sea. Had these Leviathans been', 'but a flock of simple sheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce', 'wolves, they could not possibly have evinced such excessive', 'dismay. But this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all', 'herding creatures. Though banding together in tens of thousands, the', 'lion-maned buffaloes of the West have fled before a solitary', 'horseman. Witness, too, all human beings, how when herded together in', \"the sheepfold of a theatre's pit, they will, at the slightest alarm\", 'of fire, rush helter-skelter for the outlets, crowding, trampling,', 'jamming, and remorselessly dashing each other to death. Best,', 'therefore, withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales', 'before us, for there is no folly of the beast of the earth which is', 'not infinitely outdone by the madness of men.', '', 'Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,', 'yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced', 'nor retreated, but collectively remained in one place. As is', 'customary in those cases, the boats at once separated, each making', 'for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal. In about three', \"minutes' time, Queequeg's harpoon was flung; the stricken fish darted\", 'blinding spray in faces, and then running away with us like light,', 'steered straight for the heart of the herd. Though such a movement on', 'the part of the whale struck under such circumstances, is in no wise', 'unprecedented; and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated;', 'yet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the', 'fishery. For as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into', 'the frantic shoal, you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist', 'in a delirious throb.', '', 'As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power', 'of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him;', 'as we thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we', 'flew, by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset', 'boat was like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving', 'to steer through complicated channels and straits, knowing not at', 'what moment it may be locked in and crushed.', '', 'But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off', 'from this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging', 'away from that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while', 'all the time, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking', 'out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for', 'there was no time to make long ones. Nor were the oarsmen quite idle,', 'though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with. They', 'chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business.  \"Out of the', 'way, Commodore!\" cried one, to a great dromedary that of a sudden', 'rose bodily to the surface, and for an instant threatened to swamp', 'us. \"Hard down with your tail, there!\" cried a second to another,', 'which, close to our gunwale, seemed calmly cooling himself with his', 'own fan-like extremity.', '', 'All whale-boats carry certain curious contrivances, originally', 'invented by the Nantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares', 'of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they', \"cross each other's grain at right angles; a line of considerable\", 'length is then attached to the middle of this block, and the other', 'end of the line being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a', 'harpoon. It is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is', 'used. For then, more whales are close round you than you can possibly', 'chase at one time. But sperm whales are not every day encountered;', 'while you may, then, you must kill all you can. And if you cannot', 'kill them all at once, you must wing them, so that they can be', 'afterwards killed at your leisure. Hence it is, that at times like', 'these the drug, comes into requisition. Our boat was furnished with', 'three of them. The first and second were successfully darted, and we', 'saw the whales staggeringly running off, fettered by the enormous', 'sidelong resistance of the towing drugg. They were cramped like', 'malefactors with the chain and ball. But upon flinging the third, in', 'the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block, it caught under', 'one of the seats of the boat, and in an instant tore it out and', \"carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the boat's bottom as the\", 'seat slid from under him. On both sides the sea came in at the', 'wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in,', 'and so stopped the leaks for the time.', '', 'It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were', \"it not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale's way greatly\", 'diminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from', 'the circumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed', 'waning. So that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the', 'towing whale sideways vanished; then, with the tapering force of his', 'parting momentum, we glided between two whales into the innermost', 'heart of the shoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into', 'a serene valley lake. Here the storms in the roaring glens between', 'the outermost whales, were heard but not felt. In this central', 'expanse the sea presented that smooth satin-like surface, called a', 'sleek, produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his', 'more quiet moods. Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they', 'say lurks at the heart of every commotion. And still in the', 'distracted distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric', 'circles, and saw successive pods of whales, eight or ten in each,', 'swiftly going round and round, like multiplied spans of horses in a', 'ring; and so closely shoulder to shoulder, that a Titanic', 'circus-rider might easily have over-arched the middle ones, and so', 'have gone round on their backs. Owing to the density of the crowd of', 'reposing whales, more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the', 'herd, no possible chance of escape was at present afforded us. We', 'must watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the', 'wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us up. Keeping at the', 'centre of the lake, we were occasionally visited by small tame cows', 'and calves; the women and children of this routed host.', '', 'Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving', 'outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods', 'in any one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture,', 'embraced by the whole multitude, must have contained at least two or', 'three square miles. At any rate- though indeed such a test at such a', 'time might be deceptive- spoutings might be discovered from our low', 'boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon. I', 'mention this circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had', 'been purposely locked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide', 'extent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the', 'precise cause of its stopping; or, possibly, being so young,', 'unsophisticated, and every way innocent and inexperienced; however it', 'may have been, these smaller whales- now and then visiting our', 'becalmed boat from the margin of the lake- evinced a wondrous', 'fearlessness and confidence, or else a still becharmed panic which it', 'was impossible not to marvel at. Like household dogs they came', 'snuffing round us, right up to our gunwales, and touching them; till', 'it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated', 'them. Queequeg patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched their backs', 'with his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the time', 'refrained from darting it.', '', 'But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and', 'still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For,', 'suspended in those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing', 'mothers of the whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed', 'shortly to become mothers. The lake, as I have hinted, was to a', 'considerable depth exceedingly transparent; and as human infants', 'while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as', 'if leading two different lives at the time; and while yet drawing', 'mortal nourishment, be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly', 'reminiscence;- even so did the young of these whales seem looking up', 'towards us, but not at us, as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in', 'their new-born sight. Floating on their sides, the mothers also', 'seemed quietly eyeing us. One of these little infants, that from', 'certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old, might have measured', 'some fourteen feet in length, and some six feet in girth. He was a', 'little frisky; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered', 'from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal', 'reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready for the final spring,', \"the unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar's bow. The delicate\", 'side-fins, and the palms of his flukes, still freshly retained the', \"plaited crumpled appearance of a baby's ears newly arrived from\", 'foreign parts.', '', '\"Line! line!\" cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; \"him fast!', 'him fast!- Who line him! Who struck?- Two whale; one big, one', 'little!\"', '', '\"What ails ye, man?\" cried Starbuck.', '', '\"Look-e here,\" said Queequeg, pointing down.', '', 'As when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds', 'of fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and', 'shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling', 'towards the air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical', 'cord of Madame Leviathan, by which the young cub seemed still', 'tethered to its dam. Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the', 'chase, this natural line, with the maternal end loose, becomes', 'entangled with the hempen one, so that the cub is thereby', 'trapped. Some of the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed divulged to', 'us in this enchanted pond. We saw young Leviathan amours in the', 'deep.', '', 'And thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations', 'and affrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely', 'and fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments; yes, serenely', 'revelled in dalliance and delight. But even so, amid the tornadoed', 'Atlantic of my being, do I myself still for ever centrally disport in', 'mute calm; and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round', 'me, deep down and deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal', 'mildness of joy.', '', 'Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic', 'spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats,', 'still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or', 'possibly carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance', 'of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them. But the', 'sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to', 'and fro across the circles, was nothing to what at last met our', 'eyes. It is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than', 'commonly powerful and alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by', 'sundering or maiming his gigantic tail-tendon. It is done by darting', 'a short-handled cutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for', 'hauling it back again. A whale wounded (as we afterwards learned) in', 'this part, but not effectually, as it seemed, had broken away from', 'the boat, carrying along with him half of the harpoon line; and in', 'the extraordinary agony of the wound, he was now dashing among the', 'revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado Arnold, at the', 'battle of Saratoga, carrying dismay wherever he went.', '', 'But agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling', 'spectacle enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he', 'seemed to inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at', 'first the intervening distance obscured from us. But at length we', 'perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery,', 'this whale had become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed; he', 'had also run away with the cutting-spade in him; and while the free', 'end of the rope attached to that weapon, had permanently caught in', 'the coils of the harpoon-line round his tail, the cutting-spade', 'itself had worked loose from his flesh. So that tormented to madness,', 'he was now churning through the water, violently flailing with his', 'flexible tail, and tossing the keen spade about him, wounding and', 'murdering his own comrades.', '', 'This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their', 'stationary fright.  First, the whales forming the margin of our lake', 'began to crowd a little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted', 'by half spent billows from afar; then the lake itself began faintly', 'to heave and swell; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries', 'vanished; in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more', 'central circles began to swim in thickening clusters. Yes, the long', 'calm was departing. A low advancing hum was soon heard; and then like', 'to the tumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river Hudson', 'breaks up in Spring, the entire host of whales came tumbling upon', 'their inner centre, as if to pile themselves up in one common', 'mountain. Instantly Starbuck and Queequeg changed places; Starbuck', 'taking the stern.', '', '\"Oars! Oars!\" he intensely whispered, seizing the helm- \"gripe your', 'oars, and clutch your souls, now! My God, men, stand by! Shove him', 'off, you Queequeg- the whale there!- prick him!- hit him! Stand up-', 'stand up, and stay so! Spring men- pull, men; never mind their backs-', 'scrape them!- scrape away!\"', '', 'The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving', 'a narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths. But by desperate', 'endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening; then giving way', 'rapidly, and at the same time earnestly watching for another', 'outlet. After many similar hair-breadth escapes, we at last swiftly', 'glided into what had just been one of the outer circles, but now', 'crossed by random whales, all violently making for one centre. This', \"lucky salvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of Queequeg's hat,\", 'who, while standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales, had his', 'hat taken clean from his head by the air-eddy made by the sudden', 'tossing of a pair of broad flukes close by.', '', 'Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon', 'resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having', 'clumped together at last in one dense body, they then renewed their', 'onward flight with augmented fleetness. Further pursuit was useless;', 'but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged', 'whales might be dropped astern, and likewise to secure one which', 'Flask had killed and waited. The waif is a pennoned pole, two or', 'three of which are carried by every boat; and when additional game is', 'at hand, are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale,', 'both to mark its place on the sea, and also as token of prior', 'possession, should the boats of any other ship draw near.', '', 'The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that', 'sagacious saying in the Fishery,- the more whales the less fish. Of', 'all the drugged whales only one was captured.  The rest contrived to', 'escape for the time, but only to be taken, as will hereafter be seen,', 'by some other craft than the Pequod.', '', 'The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but', 'unlike most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a', 'gestation which may probably be set down at nine months, producing', 'but one at a time; though in some few known instances giving birth to', 'an Esau and Jacob:- a contingency provided for in suckling by two', 'teats, curiously situated, one on each side of the anus; but the', 'breasts themselves extend upwards from that.

Now how', 'did this odious stigma originate?', '', 'I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the', 'Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries', 'ago. Because those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out', 'their oil at sea as the Southern ships have always done; but cutting', 'up the fresh blubber in small bits, thrust it through the bung holes', 'of large casks, and carry it home in that manner; the shortness of', 'the season in those Icy Seas, and the sudden and violent storms to', 'which they are exposed, forbidding any other course. The consequence', 'is, that upon breaking into the hold, and unloading one of these', 'whale cemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a savor is given forth', 'somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an old city', 'graveyard, for the foundations of a Lying-in Hospital.', '', 'I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be', 'likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in', 'former times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg,', 'which latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in', 'his great work on Smells, a text-book on that subject. As its name', 'imports (smeer, fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in', 'order to afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to', 'be tried out, without being taken home to Holland for that', 'purpose. It was a collection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds;', 'and when the works were in full operation certainly gave forth no', 'very pleasant savor. But all this is quite different with a South Sea', 'Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four years perhaps, after', 'completely filling her hold with oil, does not, perhaps, consume', 'fifty days in the business of boding out; and in the state that it is', 'casked, the oil is nearly scentless.  The truth is, that living or', 'dead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by no means', 'creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as the people', 'of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company, by the', 'nose. Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant,', 'when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high health; taking', 'abundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true,', \"seldom in the open air. I say, that the motion of a Sperm Whale's\", 'flukes above water dispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented lady', 'rustles her dress in a warm parlor. What then shall I liken the Sperm', 'Whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude? Must it not be to', 'that famous elephant, with jeweled tusks, and redolent with myrrh,', 'which was led out of an Indian town to do honor to Alexander the', 'Great?', '', '', '', '', 'The Castaway', '', '', 'It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman, that a', \"most significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod's\", 'crew; an event most lamentable; and which ended in providing the', 'sometimes madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever', 'accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her', 'own.', '', 'Now, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the', 'boats. Some few hands are reserved called shipkeepers, whose province', 'it is to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale. As a', 'general thing, these shipkeepers are as hardy fellows as the men', \"comprising the boats' crews. But if there happen to be an unduly\", 'slender, clumsy, or timorous wight in the ship, that wight is certain', 'to be made a ship-keeper. It was so in the Pequod with the little', 'negro Pippin by nick-name, Pip by abbreviation. Poor Pip! ye have', 'heard of him before; ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic', 'midnight, so gloomy-jolly.', '', 'In outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony', 'and a white one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar color,', 'driven in one eccentric span. But while hapless Dough-Boy was by', 'nature dull and torpid in his intellects, Pip, though over', 'tender-hearted, was at bottom very bright, with that pleasant,', 'genial, jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe; a tribe, which ever', 'enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer, freer relish than any', \"other race. For blacks, the year's calendar should show naught but\", \"three hundred and sixty-five Fourth of Julys and New Year's Days. Nor\", 'smile so, while I write that this little black was brilliant, for', 'even blackness has its brilliancy; behold yon lustrous ebony,', \"panelled in king's cabinets. But Pip loved life, and all life's\", 'peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking business in which he', 'had somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had most sadly blurred', 'his brightness; though, as ere long will be seen, what was thus', 'temporarily subdued in him, in the end was destined to be luridly', 'illumined by strange wild fires, that fictitiously showed him off to', 'ten times the natural lustre with which in his native Tolland County', \"in Connecticut, he had once enlivened many a fiddler's frolic on the\", 'green; and at melodious even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned the', 'round horizon into one star-belled tambourine. So, though in the', 'clear air of day, suspended against a blue-veined neck, the', 'pure-watered diamond drop will healthful glow; yet, when the cunning', 'jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre, he', 'lays it against a gloomy ground, and then lights it up, not by the', 'sun, but by some unnatural gases. Then come out those fiery', 'effulgences, infernally superb; then the evil-blazing diamond, once', 'the divinest symbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel', 'stolen from the King of Hell. But let us to the story.', '', \"It came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb's after-oarsman\", 'chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed;', 'and, temporarily, Pip was put into his place.', '', 'The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness;', 'but happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and', 'therefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb', 'observing him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his', 'courageousness to the utmost, for he might often find it needful.', '', 'Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as', 'the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which', \"happened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip's seat. The\", 'involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in', 'hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack', 'whale line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with', 'him, so as to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the', 'water. That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the', 'line swiftly straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up', 'to the chocks of the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line,', 'which had taken several turns around his chest and neck.', '', 'Tashtego stood in the bows. He was full of the fire of the hunt. He', 'hated Pip for a poltroon. Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath,', 'he suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb,', 'exclaimed interrogatively, \"Cut?\" Meantime Pip\\'s blue, choked face', \"plainly looked, Do, for God's sake! All passed in a flash. In less\", 'than half a minute, this entire thing happened.', '', '\"Damn him, cut!\" roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was', 'saved.', '', 'So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed', 'by yells and execrations from the crew. Tranquilly permitting these', 'irregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain,', 'business-like, but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially;', 'and that done, unofficially gave him much wholesome advice. The', 'substance was, Never jump from a boat, Pip, except- but all the rest', 'was indefinite, as the soundest advice ever is. Now, in general,', 'Stick to the boat, is your true motto in whaling; but cases will', 'sometimes happen when Leap from the boat, is still better. Moreover,', 'as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted', 'conscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving him too wide a', 'margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice,', 'and concluded with a peremptory command \"Stick to the boat, Pip, or', \"by the Lord, I won't pick you up if you jump; mind that. We can't\", 'afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for', 'thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama. Bear that in mind, and', 'don\\'t jump any more.\" Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that', 'though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal, which', 'propensity too often interferes with his benevolence.', '', 'But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was', 'under very similar circumstances to the first performance; but this', 'time he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale', 'started to run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried', \"traveller's trunk. Alas! Stubb was but too true to his word. It was a\", 'beautiful, bounteous, blue day! the spangled sea calm and cool, and', \"flatly stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like gold-beater's\", 'skin hammered out to the extremest. Bobbing up and down in that sea,', \"Pip's ebon head showed like a head of cloves. No boat-knife was\", \"lifted when he fell so rapidly astern. Stubb's inexorable back was\", 'turned upon him; and the whale was winged. In three minutes, a whole', 'mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and Stubb. Out from the', 'centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his crisp, curling, black head to', 'the sun, another lonely castaway, though the loftiest and the', 'brightest.', '', 'Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the', 'practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore. But the', 'awful lonesomeness is intolerable. The intense concentration of self', 'in the middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it?', 'Mark, how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea- mark how', 'closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides.', '', 'But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate? No;', 'he did not mean to, at least. Because there were two boats in his', 'wake, and he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to', 'Pip very quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such', 'considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own', 'timidity, is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar', 'instances; and such instances not unfrequently occur; almost', 'invariably in the fishery, a coward, so called, is marked with the', 'same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies and armies.', '', 'But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly', 'spying whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and', \"Stubb's boat was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent\", \"upon his fish, that Pip's ringed horizon began to expand around him\", 'miserably. By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him;', 'but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot;', 'such, at least, they said he was. The sea had leeringly kept his', 'finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his soul. Not drowned', 'entirely, though. Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths, where', 'strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before', 'his passive eyes; and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his hoarded', 'heaps; and among the joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities, Pip', 'saw the multitudinous, God-omnipresent, coral insects, that out of', \"the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs. He saw God's foot\", 'upon the treadle of the loom, and spoke it; and therefore his', \"shipmates called him mad. So man's insanity is heaven's sense; and\", 'wandering from all mortal reason, man comes at last to that celestial', 'thought, which, to reason, is absurd and frantic; and weal or woe,', 'feels then uncompromised, indifferent as his God.', '', 'For the rest blame not Stubb too hardly.
